## A2 — Domains

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A2.1 | Each feature area has its own domain directory | `src/domains/{name}/` exists |
| A2.2 | Domain directories are lowercase or kebab-case | dirname matches `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/` |
| A2.3 | Each domain has a `routes.ts` barrel | `routes.ts` exists in domain dir |
| A2.4 | Domain routes barrel exports `default` | `export default routes` present |
| A2.5 | Domain route barrels are `.ts` not `.tsx` | extension is `.ts` |

### Domain Structure

```
src/domains/billing/
├── MainPage.tsx          # Default page (created by summon domain)
├── InvoicesPage.tsx      # Additional pages (created by summon route)
├── PaymentsPage.tsx
└── routes.ts             # Route barrel
```

---

## A3 — Pages

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A3.1 | Page components use `Page` suffix | name matches `*Page` |
| A3.2 | Page components are PascalCase | name matches `/^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*Page$/` |
| A3.3 | Page components are default exports | `export default function` present |
| A3.4 | Page components render `<Head>` | `Head` import and element present |
| A3.5 | Page components return `ReactElement` | return type annotated |
| A3.6 | Pages receive `params` and/or `search` from the router, not `data` | no `data` prop |
| A3.7 | Each page lives in its own file | one component per file |

### Page Pattern

```tsx
import { Head } from "@canonical/react-head";
import type { ReactElement } from "react";

export default function InvoicesPage(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <section aria-labelledby="invoices-title">
      <Head title="Invoices" />
      <h1 id="invoices-title">Invoices</h1>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Page with Params

```tsx
export default function GuidePage({
  params,
}: { params: { slug: string } }): ReactElement {
  return (
    <section aria-labelledby="guide-title">
      <Head title={params.slug} />
      <h1 id="guide-title">{params.slug}</h1>
    </section>
  );
}
```

---

## A4 — Routes

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A4.1 | Routes use `route()` from `@canonical/router-core` | import present |
| A4.2 | Routes pass components directly to `content` | `content: PageComponent` (not `content: () => <Page />`) |
| A4.3 | Route files are `.ts` not `.tsx` (no JSX in route definitions) | extension is `.ts` |
| A4.4 | Route objects use `as const` assertion | `as const` present |
| A4.5 | `warm()` is fire-and-forget — it does not return data | no data threading |
| A4.6 | No `.error` on routes — use React error boundaries | no `error` property |
| A4.7 | Search params use Standard Schema validation (`~standard`) | schema protocol used |

### Route Definition Pattern

```ts
import { route } from "@canonical/router-core";
import InvoicesPage from "./InvoicesPage.js";
import PaymentsPage from "./PaymentsPage.js";

const routes = {
  invoices: route({
    url: "/billing/invoices",
    content: InvoicesPage,
  }),
  payments: route({
    url: "/billing/payments",
    content: PaymentsPage,
  }),
} as const;

export default routes;
```

---

## A5 — Wrappers

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A5.1 | Layout components use `Layout` suffix | name matches `*Layout` |
| A5.2 | Layout components live in `src/lib/{Name}Layout/` | directory exists |
| A5.3 | Layout components accept `children` prop | `children: ReactNode` in props |
| A5.4 | Wrapper composition uses `wrapper()` + `group()` | calls present in `routes.tsx` |
| A5.5 | Layout components have barrel `index.ts` | barrel exists |

### Wrapper Wiring Pattern

```tsx
// routes.tsx
import SidebarLayout from "#lib/SidebarLayout/index.js";

const sidebarWrapper = wrapper({
  id: "sidebar",
  component: ({ children }) => <SidebarLayout>{children}</SidebarLayout>,
});

const [invoices, payments] = group(sidebarWrapper, [
  billingRoutes.invoices,
  billingRoutes.payments,
] as const);
```

---

## A6 — Middleware

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A6.1 | Cross-cutting concerns use middleware, not per-route logic | middleware function defined |
| A6.2 | Middleware transforms routes via `RouteMiddleware` type | type annotation present |
| A6.3 | Middleware wraps `warm`, not `content` | warm wrapping used |
| A6.4 | Auth redirects use `redirect()` from router-core | `redirect()` call present |

---

## A7 — SSR

Present unless the application is scaffolded with `--rendering spa`, which omits the
whole server layer. A `--rendering spa` app has no `src/server/`, no `/sitemap.xml`, and
no server-painted first paint; its client entry mounts with `createRoot`
rather than `hydrateRoot`.

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A7.1 | Server entry renders full `<html>` document as `ServerEntrypoint` | `ServerEntrypointProps` used |
| A7.2 | Express server uses `JSXRenderer.renderToPipeableStream()` | pipeable stream used |
| A7.3 | Bun server uses `JSXRenderer.renderToReadableStream()` | readable stream used |
| A7.4 | Both servers use Vite middleware mode for HMR | `createViteServer` with `middlewareMode` |
| A7.5 | Router created inside entry server component from URL | `createStaticRouter` in component |
| A7.6 | URL passed as serializable `initialData` | `{ url: string }` in initialData |
| A7.7 | Production uses platform adapters (Vercel, Cloudflare), not dev servers | servers are dev-only |

---

## A8 — Head

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A8.1 | Head management uses `@canonical/react-head` | `Head` import present |
| A8.2 | `<Head>` rendered by every page component | element present per page |
| A8.3 | One owner per document: only a route's content renders `<Head>`, never a layout or an entry | no `<Head>` outside route content |
| A8.4 | `HeadProvider titleTemplate={formatDocumentTitle}` wraps the app in every emitted entry — client, and server unless `--rendering spa` | provider present |
| A8.5 | The application name lives in `src/formatDocumentTitle.ts`, not in page titles | pages pass a bare title |
| A8.6 | The HTML shell carries no `<title>` unless `--rendering spa` | `index.html` yields to the page |
| A8.7 | The shell owns only tags no page declares — the server emits its head tags first, so a page's copy of one would lose | no overlap between `index.html` and `<Head>` |
| A8.8 | Head is separate from the router — no router dependency | no router imports in head |

---

## A9 — Navigation

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A9.1 | Links use `<Link>` from `@canonical/router-react` | `Link` import present |
| A9.2 | Navigation is by route name, not by path | `to="routeName"` pattern |
| A9.3 | Params and search are typed via route definition | TypeScript validates |
| A9.4 | Client router uses `createBrowserRouter` | factory call present |
| A9.5 | `useBlocker()` for navigation blocking on dirty forms | hook used when needed |
| A9.6 | `setSearchParams()` for search param mutation | method used for filters/pagination |

---

## A10 — Types

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A10.1 | Routes registered via `declare module` augmentation | augmentation present in `routes.tsx` |
| A10.2 | `AppRoutes` type exported from `routes.tsx` | type export present |
| A10.3 | No `as` casts in route or page code | zero cast count |
| A10.4 | No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` in generated code | zero suppression count |

---

## A11 — Data (Relay)

Present only when the application is scaffolded with `--relay`.

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A11.1 | The Relay layer lives in `src/relay/` (environment factory, mock schema, artifacts) | `src/relay/environment.ts` exists |
| A11.2 | The environment factory defaults to the local in-process mock schema; `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` (or an explicit URL) switches to an HTTP executor | `createEnvironment` branches on the URL |
| A11.3 | Compiler artifacts in `src/relay/__generated__/` are committed, never rebuilt by the app build (`codegen: false`); regenerate explicitly with the `relay` script after any schema or `graphql` tag edit | committed artifacts match schema |
| A11.4 | Data requirements are colocated: containers use `useLazyLoadQuery`, leaf components own their `useFragment`, parents just spread it | fragment per component |
| A11.5 | Query subtrees pair `Suspense` (pending state) with an `ErrorBoundary` (failure state) | both boundaries wrap the subtree |
| A11.6 | Query subtrees guard on `typeof document` / a store `check()` so the server renders them only from prefetched data (vacuously true under `--rendering spa`, where there is no server) | guard present on query subtrees |
| A11.7 | One Relay environment per browser session (module scope in the client entry); under `--rendering ssr`, additionally a fresh environment per request in the server entry | environment creation sites |

### ClientOnly (emitted, unused)

`src/lib/ClientOnly/` is emitted (and exported from the lib barrel) when
`--relay` is enabled and `--rendering spa` is not. It defers `children` until after
hydration. **Nothing in the scaffold renders it**: the catalog page now guards
on `typeof document` plus a store `check()` (A11.6), which lets the server
render the subtree when the prefetch already filled the store instead of
always deferring it. `ClientOnly` remains as a building block for subtrees
that genuinely cannot render server-side. Under `--rendering spa` it would be a
guaranteed no-op, so it is not emitted.

### Committed artifacts

`src/relay/__generated__/` ships with the scaffold as the deterministic
relay-compiler output of the committed `schema.graphql` and the catalog
queries. The Vite plugin runs with `codegen: false`, so the artifacts are a
source-of-truth input to the build, not a build product — edit a query or the
schema, run the `relay` script, and commit the regenerated artifacts.

---

## A12 — i18n

Present only when the application is scaffolded with `--intl`.

| ID | Rule | Gate |
|----|------|------|
| A12.1 | Locale config and message catalogs live in `src/i18n/` (one module per locale, re-exported from a barrel) | `src/i18n/config.ts` exists |
| A12.2 | Negotiation is a pure function over sources — cookie first, then the language list — never a runtime branch | `negotiateLocale(config, sources)` call sites |
| A12.3 | The server negotiates from the request (cookie, `Accept-Language`) and publishes the result on `__INITIAL_DATA__`; the client reuses it so hydration cannot mismatch | server entry sets it, client entry reads it |
| A12.4 | Under `--rendering spa` the same negotiation runs client-side against `document.cookie` and `navigator.languages` | client entry negotiates directly |
| A12.5 | User-facing copy goes through `useTranslation()` under `--intl`. Developer-facing prose explaining the scaffold to whoever reads it stays as literals and out of the catalogs — the templates mark those passages | `t(...)` used for chrome and user copy |
| A12.6 | Storybook exposes a locale toolbar via the `withI18n` decorator, so stories render in any catalog | decorator registered |
