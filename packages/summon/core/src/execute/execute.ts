/**
 * The summon↔pragma seam: turn a generator + a prompt strategy into a
 * `Task<GeneratorResult>` — WITHOUT running it.
 *
 * This one function is the whole seam. Both binaries build the same task here
 * and interpret it their own way: pragma's `create` verb forwards the prompt
 * strategy through `runtime.exec.promptHandler` and lets the kernel interpret
 * it under the node / dry-run / undo interpreters; the summon bin runs it via
 * `runGeneratorTask({ promptHandler })`. Same package + same handler ⇒
 * byte-identical files.
 *
 * Because `execute` returns a task and does NOT run it, `--dry-run` and
 * `--undo` keep working unchanged through the kernel's existing interpreters
 * (which mock `Prompt` effects to their defaults). The task's shape is:
 *
 *   collectAnswers → validate → confirm gate → generate → result
 *
 * The confirm gate is an ordinary `confirm` Prompt effect ({@link CONFIRM_ANSWER_KEY}):
 * the non-interactive strategies resolve it to its default (`true`) and the
 * dry-run interpreter mocks it to `true`, so it is a no-op there; the Ink
 * strategy recognises the key and renders the preview + "Proceed?" gate. It is
 * the single signal that answer collection is complete — which a streaming
 * per-question handler otherwise cannot know.
