 * The Spinner has no props of its own beyond those of the underlying icon
 * `<svg>`: it always renders the `spinner` icon and animates it. The `icon`
 * name is fixed, so it is not part of the public surface.
 *
 * Like `Icon`, the Spinner is decorative by default (`aria-hidden="true"`).
 * Pass an `aria-label` (or `aria-labelledby`) when the spinner is the only
 * indication that work is in progress; it is then exposed as a named `img`.
 * When the spinner sits inside a control that already announces its busy
 * state (e.g. a submitting Button), leave it decorative.
