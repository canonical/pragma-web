<!-- TODO(button): Use the DS Button in the example once available. -->
<!-- @component
A modal is a focused container that sits on top of the main view, requiring users to interact with it before returning to that view. The main use case is asking the user to confirm a decision they have already taken — for instance, sending a delete request.

It renders a native `<dialog>` opened as a modal, so the backdrop, focus management, page inertness and Escape handling come from the platform.

Modal is declaratively controlled by default through the [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API). The `trigger` snippet receives `triggerProps` to spread on the button that opens the modal, and buttons inside the modal can spread the `closeProps` passed to the `children` snippet. Any other button can do the same by pointing its `commandfor` at the modal's `id` and setting `command` to `"show-modal"` or `"close"`. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog) for more information.

For cases where opening or closing must be orchestrated in code, Modal can be controlled through the bindable `open` prop. With `bind:open` it stays in sync with the modal in both directions: setting it opens or closes the modal, and it updates to reflect changes made by invoker commands, `Escape`, or an outside click. Setting `open` during SSR renders the dialog open on page load without client-side JS, and it is upgraded to a true modal once hydrated.

The sections are composed by the consumer: render `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Content` and `Modal.Footer` as children. The header's title names the dialog; a modal composed without a header must carry its own `aria-label`. For heading semantics, wrap the title in a heading of the level that fits the page.

On open, the browser focuses the first focusable element in the modal — usually the header's close button, which is the recommended target when nothing needs more immediate interaction. Add [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) to the element the user is expected to interact with first, such as the first field of a form, or to the modal itself when the user is expected to activate it to dismiss it.

`import { Modal } from "@canonical/svelte-ds-global";`

## Example Usage
```svelte
<Modal>
  {#snippet trigger(triggerProps)}
    <button {...triggerProps}>Discard review</button>
  {/snippet}
  {#snippet children(closeProps, close)}
    <Modal.Header>Discard pending review?</Modal.Header>
    <Modal.Content>
      Discarding the pending review will permanently delete your comments.
    </Modal.Content>
    <Modal.Footer>
      <button {...closeProps}>Keep review</button>
      <button
        onclick={() => {
          // doSomething();
          close();
        }}
      >
        Discard review
      </button>
    </Modal.Footer>
  {/snippet}
</Modal>
```
