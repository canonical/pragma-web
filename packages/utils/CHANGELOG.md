* refactor(ds-global)!: ContextualMenu takes a flat items list with first-class separators (#811), closes [#811](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/811)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* @canonical/utils no longer exports debounce, throttle,
  humanizeNumber, pluralize, the HumanizeNumberOptions, HumanizeResult and
  PluralizeOptions types, the AllOrNone type, or any navigation export —
  annotateTree, createNavigationReducer, findAncestorPath,
  getFirstInteractiveChild, getItemId, getLastInteractiveChild, getParentItem,
  isInteractive, prepareIndex, resolveOrientation, NavigationActionType, and the
  NavigationAction, NavigationReducerOptions, NavigationState, NodeStatus,
  Orientation and OrientationConfig types. They are now exported, unchanged, from
  @canonical/ds-utils. Consumers change the import specifier and add
  @canonical/ds-utils as a dependency; no call site changes.
* `_Item<A | B>` now resolves per union member instead of to the
  union's common keys. Code that relied on the collapsed shape must instantiate
  `_Item` with the whole entry union.
* `ContextualMenu`'s `groups: MenuItem[]` prop is replaced by
  `items: MenuEntry[]`, a flat list of menu items and `{ type: "separator" }`
  entries. Migrate by concatenating each group's `items` and placing a separator
  between them.

  The `role="group"` wrappers and their `aria-label`s are gone with the grouped
  model, so labelled sections ("Recent", "All items") can no longer be expressed —
  a separator divides sections visually and for assistive technology, but does not
  name them.

  Removed, the grouped menu being their only consumer: `createCrossGroupStateReducer`
  and `getFirstEnabledLeaf` from `@canonical/utils`; `getMenuGroupProps` and
  `MenuGroupPropsResult` from `@canonical/react-hooks`; `getGroupProps` from
  `useContextualMenu`.
* `getFirstEnabledChild` and `getLastEnabledChild` are renamed to
  `getFirstInteractiveChild` and `getLastInteractiveChild`. They now skip
  presentational nodes as well as disabled ones, so "enabled" no longer describes
  what they select. There is no alias — the old name would report the old
  behaviour.
* `Item` requires a `key` or a `url`. Items with neither
  no longer type-check — give a navigable item its `url` and a
  non-navigable one a `key`. Types built on `Item` must use
  `type X = Item & { … }` rather than `interface X extends Item`, and
  `_DistributiveOmit<Item, K>` rather than `Omit<Item, K>`.
  `MenuSeparator.key` is required: write `{ type: "separator", key: "…" }`.
