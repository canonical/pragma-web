 * elements.css is a copy of pragma's three element layers, re-addressed to an

 * the workspace: it reads both sides, walks their rules, and fails when a rule,
 * a declaration, a condition or the order differs from the confined form of
 * the original. It runs without a browser: the question is what the files say,
 * not what a browser computes from them; the browser fixtures answer that one.
 *
 * The sources are read from pragma's entry rather than named: everything
 * `@canonical/styles/elements.css` composes, pragma's own copy of the three
 * layers addressed to the page, followed through its local and typography
 * imports. The mapping from a source selector to its confined form is the
 * table in `confined()` below, in words in the README's section on the
 * confined copy. The exceptions, rules that exist on one side only, each carry
 * their reason.
