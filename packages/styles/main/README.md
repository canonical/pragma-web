# @canonical/styles

This README is written for two readers: the person adding the design system to an application, and the
person maintaining this package. Where a claim can be checked by a test, the test is named.

The Canonical Design System's global stylesheet. One import brings in the reset, the typographic
engine, the design tokens, the modifier families and the layout presets. Everything this package
itself ships is in a named cascade layer, and its element-level rules style the whole page, as a
reset does — nothing is confined and nothing has to be marked. The typographic engine, which lives in
`@canonical/styles-typography` and is released with this package, is in the same layers.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/styles
```

## Usage

Import once, in your application's entry point:

```css
@import url("@canonical/styles");
```

Or from JavaScript or TypeScript:

```ts
import "@canonical/styles";
```

Then declare the surface on your root:

```html
<html class="app comfortable">
```

That single line is the root contract, and it has two parts.

| Class | What it means | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| context | The kind of surface, which sets the comfortable/dense pair for every density value. | `app`, `site` or `docs` |
| density | Which of that pair is in force. | `comfortable` or `dense` |

A colour scheme is optional: `light` or `dark` pins one, and leaving both off lets the page follow the
reader's operating system. Nothing else belongs on the root — in particular there is no class that
switches the reset on. It applies because the stylesheet is loaded.

Both classes set custom properties, which inherit, so they may sit on the document element or on any
ancestor of the components that read them — the reference application puts `app comfortable` on
`<body>`.

`ds` is not a root class and never has been. It is what every component puts on its own root, so that
a component rule can select `.ds.button` rather than `.button` and cannot collide with a page's own
class names.

**A page that also runs another CSS framework** cannot let this stylesheet restyle the half it has not
migrated, and that is what `@canonical/styles-vanilla-adapter` is for: it ships a copy of this
package's three element-level layers confined to the parts a team has handed over, keeps the two
systems out of each other's way, and bridges the theme signal between them. A test in that package
binds its copy to the files here so the two cannot drift. Nothing about that arrangement changes this
package or the markup of a page that does not need it.

## Entry points

Five. `@canonical/styles` is the one an ordinary page wants: the whole stylesheet, in the order
above. Three more are that stylesheet in parts, and the fifth is the order statement on its own, for a
package rather than a page.

| Entry | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `@canonical/styles` | everything: the values, the element rules and the layout presets. |
| `@canonical/styles/tokens.css` | every custom property the design system declares, and not one rule that selects an element. Nothing here changes the page until something reads a value from it, with one exception noted below. |
| `@canonical/styles/elements.css` | every rule the design system applies to a plain element: the reset, the root's baseline, and the typography with its baseline engine. |
| `@canonical/styles/layout.css` | the layout presets — `grid`, `subgrid`, `responsive`, `intrinsic` and `content-flow` — which claim those five class names in a page's namespace. |
| `@canonical/styles/layers.css` | the order statement and nothing else: no rule, no import, no declaration. The same statement the four above open with, for a package that needs the order fixed before it declares a layer of its own. A page never needs it. |

One exception to "changes nothing", and it is worth knowing before you import `tokens.css`. The design
tokens' generated theme sheet declares `color-scheme` on `:root`, `.light` and `.dark` alongside the
colour tokens, and that property is not inert: it decides the colour of the canvas, the form controls,
the scrollbars and the system colours, whether or not anything reads a token, and on a mixed page an
element of the other framework's carrying `light` or `dark` picks it up too. It cannot be split out
here — the sheet is generated and the declarations sit in the same rules as the tokens — so separating
them is a change to the tokens package's emitter, tracked as PRA-149. An application that must not have
it declares `color-scheme` itself, in a layer above `ds.modifiers` or unlayered. Those three
declarations are the only non-custom properties `tokens.css` carries; everything else in it is a
custom property, which does nothing until a rule reads it.

The parts exist for one reason. A page that also runs another CSS framework cannot take the element
rules: the other framework has its own `p` rule, and only one of the two can own `line-height`. Such a
page takes `tokens.css` and `layout.css`, and gets its element rules from that framework's adapter
instead, in a copy confined to the part of the page the design system owns —
`@canonical/styles-vanilla-adapter` builds that copy out of the same files `elements.css` imports.

Two properties make the parts safe to mix, and both are visible in how the entries are written.

**Every entry imports the order first, and the order is written in one file.** `layers.css` holds the
statement and nothing else; each of the four entries imports it as its first rule. The order has to
reach the browser before any rule it orders, and writing it once means two entries can never disagree
— which they could if each repeated the list, and which would leave the same rules arbitrating
differently depending on the entry a consumer picked. Measured in Chromium: a statement read through
an `@import` orders the importing sheet exactly as one written in place would.

**No entry imports another entry.** An `@layer` statement inside a layer block declares sublayers of
that layer rather than top-level layers, so an entry that composed another would nest the order
instead of sharing it. Keeping them independent means a page may load one, two or all three, in any order, and
get the same result — and that each file is fetched, parsed and applied once, which matters because a
browser treats every `@import` as its own stylesheet and de-duplicates nothing.

## Cascade Layers

Everything this package itself ships is in a named layer, and the order is fixed by one statement,
which lives in `layers.css` and which every entry imports before anything else. The typographic engine, which this package imports, is in the same
layers:

```css
@layer normalize, ds.tokens, ds.reset, ds.typography, ds.modifiers, ds.surfaces,
  ds.states, ds.components, ds.components.global, ds.components.sites,
  ds.components.documentation, ds.components.stores, ds.components.apps;
```

Read it from the bottom up — each position is an argument.

| Layer | What is in it | Why it sits where it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize` | This package's own reset. | Lowest, because everything else is meant to overrule it. |
| `ds.tokens` | The primitive values, and the spacing, motion and overflow tokens. | Above the reset, because a token has to exist before anything reads it; below everything that reads one. |
| `ds.reset` | The declarations the document root makes for itself: font, colour, line height, weight, text wrapping, font smoothing — and border-box sizing for it and everything inside. | Above the tokens because it reads them; below the typographic engine and the components, which refine what it starts. |
| `ds.typography` | The element rules that apply the typographic mapping, and the baseline engine, from `@canonical/styles-typography`. | Above the reset because it is a more specific statement about text; below the modifiers, which can retune the scale. |
| `ds.modifiers` | Theme, the typographic scale, the intent families (anticipation, criticality, emphasis, importance) and their shims, and the context and density classes. | Above typography, because a modifier's job is to shift what the layers below produced. |
| `ds.surfaces` | The surface families: `surface`, `contrasted`, `modal`. | Above the modifiers, because a surface re-points colour channels the modifiers set. |
| `ds.states` | The derived hover, active and disabled channels. | Above the surfaces, because a state is derived from whatever the surface resolved to. |
| `ds.components` | Nothing, by rule. It is the parent of the tier layers below and holds no rule of its own. | Highest of the eight top-level layers, so a component is the final word on its own box. A rule written *directly* into a parent layer sits in that layer's implicit final sublayer, which is above every named sublayer — so such a rule would outrank every tier and no component package could override it by layer. Everything this package puts in `ds.components` therefore sits in a tier. |
| `ds.components.global` | The stylesheets of the shared component packages, and this package's own layout presets. | The base of the tier tree: what every other tier refines. |
| `ds.components.sites` | The stylesheets of the sites tier. | The four second-level tiers never appear on the same page, so their order among themselves decides nothing. It is fixed here anyway, so that it can never come to depend on which package a bundler emits first. |
| `ds.components.documentation` | The stylesheets of the documentation tier. | As above. |
| `ds.components.stores` | The stylesheets of the stores tier. | As above. |
| `ds.components.apps` | The stylesheets of the shared applications tier; one application's own tier declares a layer of its own above it. | As above. |

An order statement fixes the relative order of layers the first time they appear. A later statement
may introduce new names but can never reorder the ones already fixed, so an application that needs to
interleave a layer of its own puts its statement before this import.

#### The Component Tiers

The component layers follow the design system's tier tree: who owns a component decides which layer
its rules go in, and a deeper tier wins. Three rules make that work, and they are worth stating
plainly because a package author has to follow them.

**The second level is named here, in full.** `global`, `sites`, `documentation`, `stores` and `apps`
are the design system's four second-level tiers plus the shared base, and this statement fixes their
order. A package in one of those tiers wraps its stylesheets in its own name and needs to do nothing
else.

**A sub-tier declares its own layer, and that is what sorts it above.** One application's own package
— the LXD tier, say — writes its CSS entry in this order, and the order is the whole recipe:

```css
@import url("@canonical/styles/layers.css");
@layer ds.components.apps-lxd;

@import url("./Button/styles.css");
/* … the rest of the package's sheets, each wrapped in that layer … */
```

The first line is what makes the second mean the same thing every time. A layer name is placed the
moment the browser first meets it, so a name met *before* this package's statement is read is placed
**below** the tier names that statement declares — and the sub-tier would sit under the very tiers it
is meant to beat. Whether that happened depended on which file the application's bundler emitted
first, which is not something the package can control from inside itself. Reading the statement first
settles it: the thirteen names are fixed, and `ds.components.apps-lxd`, being new, is appended after
them inside `ds.components`, where it sorts above every tier. That is the tree's own rule — the more
specific tier wins — and it means this stylesheet never has to know which applications exist.

Importing `layers.css` costs a page nothing: it is the same statement the other four entries open
with, and a second identical statement names no layer the first has not already fixed.

Measured on a scratch package entry in all four emission orders a bundler can produce: with the import
first, a rule in `ds.components.apps-lxd` beats the same rule in `ds.components.apps` and in
`ds.components.global` in 4 of 4; without it, in 1 of 4.

**Nothing is ever written directly into `ds.components`.** A declaration in a parent layer sits in
that layer's implicit final sublayer, which is above every named sublayer, so a rule written there
would outrank every tier — the opposite of what the tiers are for.

The names are tier ids from that tree, lowercased and hyphenated for a sub-tier (`apps-lxd`,
`sites-webcomponentsprototype`). They are not the context words a page puts on its root (`app`,
`site`, `docs`): a tier says who owns a component, a context says what kind of page it is being shown
on, and the two are chosen by different people for different reasons.

### What Is Layered Where

| File | Layer | Selects elements? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize.css` | `normalize` | yes |
| `reset.css` root declarations | `ds.reset` | yes |
| `reset.css` box-sizing | `ds.reset` | yes — `*`, `::before`, `::after` |
| `spacing.css` | `ds.tokens` | no |
| `motion.css` | `ds.tokens` | no |
| `overflow.css` root default | `ds.tokens` | no |
| `overflow.css` `.surface` | `ds.surfaces` | no |
| `grid.css` layout presets, and the content-flow container | `ds.components.global` | yes |
| `grid.css` `:root` defaults | `ds.components.global` | no — tokens the presets read, kept with them rather than moved to `ds.tokens` |
| `modifiers.density.css` | `ds.modifiers` | no |
| `modifiers.states.shim.css`, `modifiers.importance.shim.css`, `modifiers.criticality.shim.css` | `ds.modifiers` | no |
| `controls.hover.shim.css` | `ds.surfaces` and `ds.states` | no |
| `@canonical/styles-typography` | `ds.tokens` for its naming shims, `ds.typography` for its element rules and engine, `ds.modifiers` for the typographic scale it imports | its element rules, yes; its tokens, no |
| `@canonical/design-tokens` distribution files | `ds.tokens`, `ds.modifiers`, `ds.surfaces`, `ds.states` — each file opens its own, except `modifiers.importance.css`, which is empty and opens none | no |

The files marked yes are the ones the adapter's confined copy has to mirror. The rest are almost all
custom properties, which do nothing until a rule reads them, and a rule that reads one matches a
design-system class. Two exceptions, both deliberate and both in files this package imports
rather than writes:

- **`modifiers.theme.css` sets `color-scheme`** — `light dark` on `:root`, `light` on `.light`, `dark`
  on `.dark` — document-wide. That is the point of it: the colour scheme is what every
  `light-dark()` token resolves against, including the browser's own form controls and scrollbars, and
  it has to reach them.
- **`states.css` derives its state channels on `*`** — thirty custom properties on every element. It
  is a generated file this package does not author, and it declares nothing but custom properties, so
  its universal selector costs a page nothing it would not pay anyway.

### What Is Deliberately Unlayered

One thing: **`@font-face`**, in `fonts.css`. It defines a font for the whole document, not a style for
an element, and this stylesheet declares each face exactly once, so no layer has anything to order it
against — putting it in one would change no computed value. The file is opt-in and imported separately
so that an application already serving the same files does not download them twice.

(Layers do sort `@font-face` rules where two of them declare the same family: the higher layer's face
wins over the later one in source order. There simply are no duplicates here.)

### Where the Element-Level Rules Apply

To the whole page. Three of the layers select elements rather than declare custom properties —
`normalize`, `ds.reset` and `ds.typography` — and they apply the way a reset always has: the
stylesheet is loaded, so the rules are in force. There is no marker to add and
no subtree to nominate.

That is a deliberate ruling, not an oversight. An earlier draft of this release confined those layers
to a marked subtree so that a page running two CSS frameworks could keep them apart. The confinement
works, but it made every ordinary page pay for a problem only some pages have: a class on the root, a
browser floor it did not need, and a reset that silently did nothing if the class was forgotten.

The problem is real, so it is solved where it belongs. `@canonical/styles-vanilla-adapter` ships a
confined copy of these three layers, applying only inside the parts of a page a team has handed over,
and a test in that package binds the copy to the files here so the two cannot drift. A page that needs
it installs it; a page that does not never hears about it.

## What This Package Guarantees

| Guarantee | The check behind it |
| --- | --- |
| Every rule the package itself ships is in one of the thirteen declared layers, and the statement reaches the browser before any of them, through the import every entry opens with. The typographic engine it imports is in them too. | The order fixtures that arrive with the Vanilla adapter package read the statement out of the resolved stylesheet and check every layer name the package opens against it. A check inside this package — that the set of layers used equals the set declared — is being added separately. |
| An application tier's rule for a component beats the global tier's rule for the same component, whichever of the two a bundler loads first. | The two sublayers are named in the statement, so their order is fixed there rather than at first appearance, and the same order fixture reads it back. The component packages move into them when their stylesheets are wrapped, which is a separate change; until then both sublayers are empty and the guarantee is vacuous. |
| The package ships no `!important`. | The same fixture file. An important declaration inverts the layer order and cannot be arbitrated by layers at all, so one of them would undo the guarantee above. |
| Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, every motion duration this package defines is `0s`. | `src/motion.css`, and the reduced-motion fixture arriving with the adapter package. Zeroing the token is the mechanism: a component reads the token, so nothing has to out-rank the component's own declaration. Whether a given component honours the tokens is that package's guarantee, not this one's. Sheets that still hard-code a duration, and so still animate under the preference, are being moved onto the tokens separately: in the form package the shared input chrome (`src/index.css`) and eight component sheets (`ChoicesField`, `RichChoicesField`, `CheckboxInput`, `RadioInput`, `ColorInput`, `ComboboxInput` and its list, `FileUploadInput`, `SwitchInput`); in the global package `Tooltip`, `ContextualMenu` and `Popover`, which set their own duration property; and one application-tier sheet, the launchpad diff viewer's file header. |
| The document root declares the baseline — font, colour, line height, weight, text wrapping, font smoothing — and the page inherits from there rather than from the browser's defaults. | The computed-style fixtures arriving with the adapter package, which read those properties off every element of a rendered block. |

Two guarantees that used to sit here are the adapter's, not this package's: that a region handed over
inside a page running another CSS framework computes as it does on an ordinary page, and that nothing
reaches a bare element outside such a region. `@canonical/styles-vanilla-adapter` states and tests both.

## What This Package Does Not Guarantee

- **Unlayered application CSS beats every rule here.** That is how the cascade is defined: a rule in no
  layer outranks a rule in any layer. It is not a defect, and it is the escape hatch — but it also
  means an application that wants this package's layer order to hold for its own CSS has to put that
  CSS in a layer too. See "Migrating" below.
- **`!important` in application or third-party CSS beats every rule here**, and for important
  declarations the layer order runs backwards, so the lowest layer wins. Nothing this package can do
  changes that.
- **This stylesheet styles the whole page.** The reset reaches every `<body>`, `<button>`, `<pre>` and
  `<legend>` in the document, and the layout presets claim the class names `grid`, `subgrid`,
  `responsive`, `intrinsic` and `content-flow` wherever they appear. That is what a design system's
  reset is, and it is why a page that also runs another CSS framework needs the adapter rather than
  this entry point.
- **`color-scheme` is set on the document root wherever this stylesheet is loaded**, because that is
  what the `light-dark()` tokens and the browser's own controls resolve against. It is the one thing
  here a consumer cannot opt out of by not using a class.

### Browser Floor

| Feature | Used by | Chrome | Safari | Firefox |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `light-dark()` | every colour token, including the `--color-text` the reset declares on the root | 123 | 17.5 | 120 |
| `mod()` | the baseline engine | 125 | 15.4 | 118 |
| `cap` unit | the default baseline engine | 118 | 17.2 | 97 |

Read the table as a whole, not row by row: the floor is the highest number in each column, because the
stylesheet uses all of it. A browser without `light-dark()` drops the root's `color` declaration as
invalid and falls back to its own text colour, so the reset applies but the page is not themed.

That makes the floor for this stylesheet with its default engine **Chrome 125, Safari 17.5,
Firefox 120**. An application that swaps the default engine for `baseline-trim.css` raises it to
Chrome 133, Safari 18.2, Firefox 154. The typographic engine also uses `round()`, on the same numbers
as `mod()`; `@canonical/styles-typography`'s "Browser Support" section is the full table, engine by
engine.

The design system targets current browsers and does not carry compatibility shims for older ones. An
application that cannot move should pin a version.

## Migrating to the Layered Release

This release makes two changes that an application has to answer. Neither is markup: there is nothing
to add to your root, and the reset applies exactly where it did before.

1. **Your unlayered CSS now beats every rule in this package.** Before this release most of what the
   package shipped was unlayered too, so your overrides competed with it by source order and
   specificity, and sometimes lost. They no longer can. If you were relying on a rule of ours to win,
   it will not any more.

2. **Put your own CSS in a layer, or accept that it wins.** Either is a valid choice, and the second
   needs no work. To take the first, wrap your application's stylesheet and name your layer after the
   package's own:

   ```css
   @layer normalize, ds.tokens, ds.reset, ds.typography, ds.modifiers,
     ds.surfaces, ds.states, ds.components, ds.components.global,
     ds.components.sites, ds.components.documentation, ds.components.stores,
     ds.components.apps, app;
   @import url("@canonical/styles");

   @layer app {
     /* your CSS */
   }
   ```

   Your statement comes first and fixes `app` above every design-system layer, so your rules win by
   layer rather than by accident of order — and a rule of yours that you later want overridden by a
   component can simply be moved down.

If you import a subpath rather than the package entry — `@canonical/styles/spacing.css` and the five
other subpaths this package exports — note that a subpath carries no order statement, so the layers it
opens are ordered by wherever they first appear in your own stylesheet. Import the entry point unless
you have a reason not to.

### What Moves on the Page

Measured in Chromium, an application that is the design system's throughout, before against after, with
nothing added to the root. Four things change on every element, and one on `<hr>`; nothing else does.

| What | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `line-height`, everywhere it was not set | `1.15` inherited from the old reset | `normal` | the document root declares its own baseline |
| `color`, everywhere it was not set | `rgb(0, 0, 0)` | `oklch(0 0 0)` | the root declares `var(--color-text)`: the same black in the light scheme, but it now follows the theme instead of being the browser's default |
| `box-sizing`, everywhere | `content-box` | `border-box` | the components are authored against it |
| `font-family` on `<html>` | the browser's serif | the token stack | the root declares the font; `<body>` already had it from the typographic mapper |
| `overflow` on `<hr>` | `visible` | `hidden` | the browser's own value; a rule has no content to overflow, so nothing shows |

Two things that used to be true and are not:

- The `normalize.css` package is no longer a dependency. This package writes its own reset, so it can
  be copied into the adapter's confined build, and so that it contains only the rules the design system
  actually relies on. If your
  application imported `normalize.css` through us and wants the rest of it, depend on it directly.
- The old README said component styles override modifier styles "regardless of source order". They did
  not: the layers were declared but almost nothing was written into them. They do now.

## Design Tokens

The following token sets from `@canonical/design-tokens` are included:

| Token set | Contents | Layer it opens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sets.primitive` | Base colour palette, spacing scale, font sizes | `ds.tokens` |
| `modifiers.theme` | Light/dark theme mappings, and `color-scheme` on the document root | `ds.modifiers` |
| `modifiers.surfaces` | Surface elevation tokens | `ds.surfaces` |
| `modifiers.anticipation` | Constructive/destructive/caution intents | `ds.modifiers` |
| `modifiers.criticality` | Error/warning/success/information states | `ds.modifiers` |
| `modifiers.emphasis` | Branded/highlighted/muted emphasis | `ds.modifiers` |
| `modifiers.importance` | Primary/secondary importance levels — the generated file is empty today, so the shipped mapping is this package's own shim, and a stacked change drops the import until the generated file has content | none |
| `modifiers.typography` | The typographic scale, through `@canonical/styles-typography` | `ds.modifiers` |
| `states` | Interactive state tokens (hover, active, focus, disabled) | `ds.states` |

## Dependencies

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@canonical/design-tokens` | CSS custom properties for colour, spacing, and states |
| `@canonical/styles-typography` | Baseline grid engine and typographic scale |
