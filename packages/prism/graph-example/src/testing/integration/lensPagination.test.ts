// =============================================================================
// THE PAGINATION GUARD: the acceptance gate's blind spot, covered.
//
// The gate next door executes each lens operation ONCE, with `cursor: null`.
// It therefore cannot see a cursor regression at all — and a cursor regression
// is silent by construction on both known providers, which is what makes it
// worth a file of its own.
//
// WHY IT IS SILENT. A cursor that matches no item's identity is treated
// exactly like no cursor: `sliceConnection`'s `indexOfCursor` returns -1, the
// window starts at 0, and page 1 comes back verbatim with no error. That is a
// deliberate, documented choice (`lib/provider/connection.ts`) — cursors are
// client-supplied, and a stale one should degrade to a full page rather than a
// 500. It is the right behaviour AND it is why "the cursor stopped working"
// looks identical, at the wire, to "the reader asked for the first page".
//
// SO THE GUARD IS THE BOND, NOT THE DEGRADATION. Both providers derive a
// cursor as `base64(the node's absolute IRI)` — graph-example's `toCursor`,
// ke-graphql's `toBase64(node.uri)` — which is why a cursor minted by one is
// located by the other. The assertions below check that derivation directly:
// every cursor must decode to the IRI of the node it belongs to.
//
// 🔴 IT PINS ONE SIDE OF THE CONVENTION, AND CANNOT PIN BOTH HERE. Every
// cursor read below is minted by THIS provider, so a change to ke-graphql's
// derivation would leave this file green. The two halves are pinned in two
// suites: this one, and ke-graphql's own
// `src/testing/integration/queries.test.ts`, which asserts its cursors are
// base64 of the very IRI their node reports. One cross-provider assertion
// would need this package to depend on `@canonical/ke-graphql`, which pins
// graphql v17 where this package peers v16 — the two-majors hazard the whole
// contract arrangement exists to keep out of a single process. So the
// agreement is stated here and measured on each side separately. Read this
// file as graph-example's half, not as a guard over both.
//
// This file only ever STRENGTHENS the gate. It adds an operation nobody was
// executing under conditions nobody was executing it under; it narrows
// nothing.
//
// Test infrastructure: excluded from the build (tsconfig.build.json) and from
// coverage (vitest.config.ts).
