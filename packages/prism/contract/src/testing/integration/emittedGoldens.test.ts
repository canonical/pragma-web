// =============================================================================
// The currency gate: the compiler's COMMITTED emissions still satisfy the
// contract as it stands right now.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `src/testing/__fixtures__/emitted*.sdl.txt` are frozen
// captures. If the contract gains a promise the compiler does not keep, or the
// compiler's emitted base loses something the contract requires, nothing above
// this file would notice: the fixtures would go on satisfying the fixture-era
// contract forever. This gate reads the compiler's OWN golden SDLs — the ones
// `@canonical/ke-graphql` regenerates and pins byte-for-byte against a live
// `compile()` in its `emittedSdl.test.ts` — and checks them against the
// contract as read live from `schema/`. Both halves therefore move on their
// own, and this turns red when they stop agreeing.
//
// WHY IT READS BY PATH RATHER THAN IMPORTING. Those goldens live in
// ke-graphql's `src/testing/`, which is excluded from that package's build and
// never published, so there is nothing to import. A path is the only handle.
// The reach is in the permitted direction — `packages/prism/*` may depend on
// the runtime packages, never the reverse — and the dependency is DECLARED as
// a devDependency rather than left implicit, so `nx affected` schedules this
// suite when the compiler's goldens change. Without that edge the gate would
// simply not run on the change it exists to catch, which is the same outcome
// as not having it.
//
// WHY IT THROWS RATHER THAN SKIPS. A gate that goes quiet when its subject
// disappears is worse than no gate: it would report success for a repository
// in which the compiler's goldens had been deleted or moved, which is exactly
// the state worth noticing.
