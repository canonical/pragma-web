 * IMPLEMENTER DECISION (plan OQ-4): `EXCLUDED_SOURCES` and `CUSTOM_MAPPINGS`
 * are PINNED CONSTANTS, not `PragmaProviderOptions` fields.
 *
 * Both are facts about specific upstream ontologies rather than about any
 * caller, and both have a documented upstream remedy that DELETES them (a
 * `graphql:name` annotation on `anatomy:uri`; a modelling fix for
 * `shim-concept.ttl`). Exposing them as options would mean a second caller
 * could pass a different value and silently compile a schema incompatible with
 * the `schema.graphql` relay-compiler reads — the same class of divergence
 * `mode`/`prefixing` are pinned against in `createPragmaProvider`. The whole
 * point of this file is that there is ONE place these live and one answer to
 * "why is this here"; an option turns that into "it depends who called".
 *
 * The cost is real and accepted: a consumer who needs different exclusions
 * must fork or send a PR. That is the correct friction for a value whose
 * existence is a bug report against an ontology.

 * The one custom mapping this graph cannot boot without.
 *
 * `anatomy:uri` is an ordinary `owl:DatatypeProperty` on the anatomy DSL's
 * `NamedNode` class, and it maps to the GraphQL field name `uri` — which the
 * converged base RESERVES: `uri: ID!` is the primary key the compiler
 * injects on every Node implementer. The compiler used to rename such a
 * collision silently (M002, which is where the committed `anatomyUri` came
 * from); the converged compiler removed that branch, because a silent
 * rename breaks the consumer's query without telling them which IRI did it.
 * It now reports M005 — DROPPED, severity `error` — and `runPasses` refuses
 * to hand out a schema with any error in it, so the whole boot dies.
 *
 * That last sentence is no longer prose: `createPragmaProvider.test.ts`
 * boots the hermetic corpus with and without this mapping and asserts the
 * observed behaviour. See that test's header for the measurement.
 *
 * The remedy the diagnostic names is a custom mapping, and this is it. The
 * name it restores is exactly the one the schema already carried, so nothing
 * downstream moves. (`prefixing: "all"`, the other remedy, would rename
 * EVERY field in the schema to clear one collision.)
 *
 * `mappings` is deprecated in favour of a `graphql:name` annotation on the
 * term itself — the right home for this, since the collision is a fact about
 * the anatomy ontology and not about this package. That ontology lives in the
 * anatomy DSL's own repository, outside this monorepo, so the annotation is
 * an upstream change; when it lands, delete this. (MEASURED at pragma
 * `4d228c8`: the anatomy ontology reaches this package only through the pragma
 * refs cache. It is deliberately NOT vendored into this repository and must
 * not be — the corpus under `src/testing/__fixtures__/corpus` is a
 * hand-written stand-in that declares the colliding IRI verbatim, so the
 * collision stays testable without a copy of someone else's ontology in our
 * tree.)
