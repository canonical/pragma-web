/**
 * Walking pragma's two source roots into one ordered, escaped, filtered list.
 *
 * The graph compiles from TWO roots into ONE store:
 *
 *   1. the pragma CLI's refs cache — for each cached source package
 *      (design-system, code-standards, anatomy-dsl), every `.ttl` under
 *      `definitions/` and `data/`;
 *   2. the semantics working tree — the `surface` ontology and the
 *      `design-system-docs` graph that instantiates it: the docsite's own
 *      demand model (jobs, coordinates, pairings, surfaces, layouts), which
 *      the journeys lens reads.
 *
 * Both roots skip dot-prefixed entries (editor and channel artifacts such as
 * `.modifier.dark.ttl` are not graph sources, and a dot-prefixed Turtle local
 * name is not even valid RDF).
 *
 * WHY THIS TAKES ROOTS RATHER THAN READING THE ENVIRONMENT. In the app this
 * function resolved `$PRAGMA_REFS_DIR` itself, which made it untestable: the
 * only way to exercise it was to have a populated refs cache. Roots are now an
 * argument, `resolveRefsRoot`/`resolveSemRoot` are separately testable, and
 * the package's whole test suite runs against a checked-in corpus
 * (`src/testing/__fixtures__/corpus`) that needs neither cache nor semantics tree.
