/**
 * Merge every prefix declared in the sources' Turtle prologues.
 *
 * Necessary because ke's `createStore` does not fold parsed-Turtle prefixes
 * into `store.prefixes`, and the compiler needs them to shorten IRIs into the
 * local names that become GraphQL field names. Last declaration wins, which is
 * sound here: pragma's corpus declares each label consistently, and a genuine
 * conflict would surface as a renamed field in the emitted SDL rather than
 * silently.
 *
 * Only real directives count. Comments and string literals are blanked first,
 * so a retired declaration left behind as `# was @prefix ds: <old>`, or one
 * quoted inside an annotation, cannot win the last-declaration rule and hand
 * the compiler a namespace the Turtle parser never applied.
