// =============================================================================
// The boot, against the hermetic corpus — including the anatomy collision.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔬 THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, AND HOW IT WAS OBTAINED.
//
// `CUSTOM_MAPPINGS` carries one entry, `anatomy:uri → anatomyUri`, and the
// constant's prose says the boot "dies loudly" without it. Two documents in
// this repo DISAGREED about whether that is true at this commit: R.03 records
// R-4's fatality escalation as "error+drop implemented; fatality PENDING",
// while the app's former `graphql.ts` asserted the fatality as established
// fact. One of them had to be stale.
//
// It was resolved by RUNNING IT, not by reading either document: the corpus
// below was compiled twice at pragma `4d228c8`, once with `CUSTOM_MAPPINGS`
// and once with `{}`. OBSERVED, verbatim:
//
//   WITH    → boot succeeds; SDL carries `anatomyUri: String` on `NamedNode`;
//             one diagnostic, `V014`, severity `info`.
//   WITHOUT → boot THROWS `CompilationError`, message
//             "ke-graphql: compilation failed with 1 error(s)", carrying
//             `M005 … maps to NamedNode.uri, a structural field the compiler
//             owns — the field is DROPPED."  The diagnostic's severity is
//             `error`, and `runPasses`' compile-level fatality gate refuses to
//             hand out the schema.
//
// SO THE FATALITY IS LIVE AT `4d228c8` AND R.03's "pending" IS THE STALE
// DOCUMENT. The assertions below are written from that observation. If a
// future ke-graphql change downgrades M005 to a warning, this file goes red —
// which is the correct outcome, because the app's committed `schema.graphql`
// would then quietly lose a field instead of refusing to build.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔴 THE DEFAULT IS NO WRITE, AND EXACTLY ONE TEST DEPARTS FROM IT. Omitting
// `sdlOutput` writes nothing, with no default path to fall back to — a
// property of the option's shape rather than of this file's discipline, and
// what makes every other test here safe to run against any root. The one
// exception is the `sdlOutput` test below, which passes a freshly created
// temporary destination, asserts the file was written, and removes the
// directory afterwards: the write is proved somewhere isolated rather than
// left as an untested claim. See `createPragmaProvider.ts`'s header.
