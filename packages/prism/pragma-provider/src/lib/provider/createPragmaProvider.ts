/**
 * The pragma provider: TTL corpus → Oxigraph store → executable schema →
 * fetch-native handler.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPLEMENTER DECISION 1 (plan OQ-5): `sdlOutput` is OPTIONAL, and its absence
 * means NO WRITE. It has no default and this package never derives one.
 *
 * The alternative — making it REQUIRED, so omitting it is a type error — is a
 * stronger guard against the specific accident this shape exists to prevent
 * (see below), and it was a close call. It was rejected because it forces
 * `demo/server.ts` to invent an SDL path it does not want, and inventing a
 * path is precisely the failure being designed out: a provider that must name
 * a file has to have an opinion about where the consumer's source tree is.
 * Optional-no-write means the default behaviour of this package is to write
 * nothing, anywhere, ever, which is the safest possible default and the one
 * that needs no reviewer to check it.
 *
 * THE ACCIDENT IT PREVENTS. The app's former `src/server/graphql.ts` derived
 * the path itself:
 *
 *     const SDL_OUTPUT_PATH = fileURLToPath(
 *       new URL("../relay/schema.graphql", import.meta.url),
 *     );
 *
 * Carried into this package unchanged, that resolves relative to THIS file —
 * so the app's schema would be written into `packages/prism/pragma-provider/`
 * (or into `node_modules/`), `tsc --noEmit` would pass, `biome check` would
 * pass, and every test in the repo would pass. Only a boot reveals it, and a
 * boot needs a populated refs cache. The guard is therefore structural, not a
 * test: there is no path in this package to get wrong. The consumer passes one
 * or nothing happens. `createPragmaProvider.test.ts` covers both branches, and
 * the boot log names the resolved path so a live run says which it took.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPLEMENTER DECISION 2 (plan §3, item 6 of its bad-ideas list): the
 * `getGraphqlBackend()` memoising singleton is DROPPED. This is a plain
 * factory.
 *
 * That singleton was a lazy promise cache that forgot a rejected boot so the
 * next request would retry. Its justification was the pre-split world where
 * the backend was mounted INSIDE whichever web server was running and booted
 * on first GraphQL request — retry-on-failure mattered because a request could
 * arrive before the refs cache was ready. Since the PRD-3 process split the
 * only caller is the standalone graph server, which awaits exactly one boot at
 * module top level, before it listens, and exits non-zero if it fails. There is
 * no second call to memoise and no request to retry. Keeping the machinery
 * would mean shipping prose describing a world that no longer exists, which is
 * the thing this despecialization train is mostly about not doing.
 *
 * A caller that genuinely wants one shared instance holds the promise itself —
 * which is one line at the call site.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `mode` and `prefixing` ARE PASSED EXPLICITLY. The app set neither, so it ran
 * at ke-graphql's defaults by accident. They are pinned here because
 * `prefixing: "none"` is what makes the emitted field names byte-compatible
 * with the committed `schema.graphql` that relay-compiler reads: `prefixing:
 * "all"` would namespace-prefix EVERY field in the schema (the blanket M005
 * remedy) and invalidate every committed Relay artifact at once. An implicit
 * default that a dependency bump could change is exactly the kind of unstated
 * fact this package exists to write down. They are constants, not options,
 * for the same reason `CUSTOM_MAPPINGS` is (see config/constants.ts).
