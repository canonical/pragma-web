/**
 * A runnable endpoint for the pragma provider.
 *
 *   bun run serve                       # GraphiQL at http://127.0.0.1:5177/graphql
 *   PRAGMA_REFS_DIR=… bun run serve     # against a cache somewhere else
 *
 * Port 5177 by default: the docsite's own graph holds 5175 and
 * prism-graph-example holds 5176, so all three run at once and the same lenses
 * can be pointed at any of them via the docsite's `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL`.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS WILL NOT BOOT WITHOUT A POPULATED PRAGMA REFS CACHE, and that is
 * correct behaviour rather than a defect. `collectTtlSources` throws before an
 * Oxigraph store is ever created, carrying the remedy ("run `pragma sources
 * update`"). A demo that fabricated a graph to have something to serve would
 * be demonstrating something other than this provider.
 *
 * It passes NO `sdlOutput`, so it writes no file. See
 * `src/lib/provider/createPragmaProvider.ts` for why that is the default.
 *
 * Not part of the published build (tsconfig.build.json covers src/ only); it
 * is type-checked and linted like everything else.
