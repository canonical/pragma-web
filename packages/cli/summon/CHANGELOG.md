### BREAKING CHANGES

* summon-core no longer exposes an embedded template store —
callers pass a real path to `loadTemplate`. `GeneratorCliHost`,
`registerGeneratorCommands` on the main projection subpath, the
`writeUsageError` hook and the message-only usage-error exports are gone.
`summon application react` no longer accepts `--no-ssr`/`--no-router`.

* feat(pragma)!: mount summon's generators instead of mirroring them

pragma's `create` verb hand-maintained a copy of summon's generator surface —
a flag list in `constants.ts`, an adapter that mapped it back, and a PROTECTED
test asserting the copy still matched. Every generator change had to be made
twice, and that test was the only thing between a drifted mirror and a
silently wrong CLI.

`mount.ts` replaces all of it, adapting the projection summon-core now exposes
onto pragma's kernel: synthesising VerbSpecs, wiring dispatch and completion,
enforcing the path jail, and emitting the generated reference. There is one
description of a generator's surface and both binaries read it. `--intl`
arriving on application/react needed no edit here at all; under the mirror it
would have needed two.

Kernel changes that made the mount possible: `kernel/spec` gains the types and
emitters for a synthesised verb, `dispatch` and `completion/model` handle a
verb tree resolved at runtime, and `error/types`/`renderError` carry the
generator error codes so an invalid answer exits 2 rather than surfacing as an
internal error.

`create` help now renders in pragma's house style like every other noun —
previously it emitted no colour at all and bypassed the style seam, so
`NO_COLOR` and theming never reached it. Because presentation is now
deliberately host-owned, the cross-CLI contract's help cells assert structural
parity (same groups, rows, order, defaults) with a non-empty guard, while
every other cell stays byte-for-byte.

Also here: the perf gate's `globalSetup` builds `dist` once behind a
cross-process lock instead of once per worker, `scripts/codegen.ts` generates
the create surface the covenant checks against, and the retired-flag migration
handler no longer matches commands that never carried the flag.
* `--ssr` and `--router` are gone from `pragma create
application` — the generator no longer declares them. The
`@canonical/summon-component/embedded` subpath export is removed along with
its last consumer.

* fix(pragma-cli,summon): make build-lock waiters re-acquire before re-statting freshness

The waiter arm of buildUnderLock (pragma-cli src/testing/perf/
globalSetup.ts:187, summon twin src/testing/globalSetup.ts:142) paired a
lock-free existsSync with an isFresh() stat — two unsynchronised
observations. After existsSync saw no lock, a new holder could acquire it
and begin an in-place rebuild; the waiter then read mid-flight mtimes as
fresh and consumed the torn artifact the lock exists to prevent. The
waiter now always loops back to acquire the lock and re-stats only under
it, in both TWIN copies, keeping their shared docblock in step.

The contention test's driver isFresh is now also an ownership sentinel:
it drops a violation file whenever it runs while the lockfile is absent
or carries another pid, so any freshness observation outside the
waiter's own lock goes red deterministically (verified red against the
removed fast path).

* fix(pragma-cli): stop offering mutation flags on mounted namespace completions

toMountedEntry (src/kernel/completion/model.ts:250) stamped the owning
verb's mutates onto every node of a mounted subtree, so the completion
walk offered --dry-run/--undo/--yes at a namespace position — but
registerGeneratorCommands registers the host mutation trio on runnable
leaves only, so an accepted suggestion like `create component --dry-run
react` exits 2 as an unknown option (verified live). A node with
children is now non-mutating for completion; the verb's mutability
descends to the leaves. The literal namespace-tier pin and the
emitSurface agreement assertion are updated to the registered grammar.

* fix(pragma-cli): complete registered positional-prompt flags on create leaves

leafChild (src/capabilities/create/mount.ts:466) filtered positional
prompts out of a leaf's completion flag list, but addPromptOptions
(summon-core registerGeneratorCommands.ts:94) registers EVERY prompt as
an option with no positional filter — `--component-path <value>` and
`--app-path <value>` are real registered flags (they appear in the
leaf's own --help) that completion silently withheld. Every prompt now
contributes its flag; the positional argument stays an additional
spelling. The literal leaf-tier pins gain the positional-prompt flags.

* fix(pragma-cli): stop retired-flag detection reading past the option terminator

handleProgramError's retired-grammar scan (src/bin.ts:314) matched
--framework anywhere in stripped argv, so a parse failure on `create
component react --bogus -- --framework` — where --framework is an
operand — emitted the R1 migration message instead of the real
`unknown option '--bogus'` (verified live). The scan now reuses
globalFlags' option-terminator concept via the newly exported
selectScanSpan (src/kernel/project/cli/globalFlags.ts), restricting
detection to the pre-`--` span; a subprocess regression test pins the
honest error.





# Unreleased

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **`@canonical/cli-core` is deleted.** It was the v1 shared-CLI framework, and
  the v1 name dies with the v1 model: the pragma kernel dropped the dependency
  when it built its own command grammar, and every symbol summon still imported
  from it had already been moved down into `@canonical/summon-core` and was
  being served by a re-export shim. The summon bin now imports those symbols
  from `@canonical/summon-core` directly. `packages/cli/` is left with the two
  product binaries and zero framework packages.

  For consumers: `@canonical/cli-core` is no longer published. If you imported
  from it, the surviving symbols — `runGeneratorTask`, `createGeneratorStamp`,
  `createStampOnEffectStart`, `answerPromptWithDefaults`, the effect formatters
  (`formatEffectLine`, `formatEffectWithContent`, `formatContentPreview`,
  `formatLlmHelp`/`formatLlmJson`/`formatLlmMarkdown`, `isVisibleEffect`, …) —
  are exported by `@canonical/summon-core` under the same names, except
  `promptForAnswers`, which is `collectAnswers` there. The rest of cli-core (the
  v1 `CommandDefinition` type, `registerAll`, its help/completion derivation and
  output adapters, `convertGenerator`, `executeGenerator`) has no successor in
  this package: those concerns live inside the pragma kernel's command grammar,
  whose extraction into a shared package is tracked separately.

* **One interaction model — non-interactive runs without complete input now
  REFUSE (exit 2).** Summon adopts the shared interaction decision it now
  shares verbatim with `pragma create` (the contract is executed, not
  written down: summon-core's projection suite pins the decision and
  pragma's `crossCli.subprocess.test.ts` runs both CLIs over the same argv
  and compares what they emit). Three behaviors that
  previously fell through to mounting the Ink UI are now loud, scriptable
  failures:

  - **Non-TTY refusal**: a piped/CI run of a generator without `--yes`,
    `--dry-run`, `--undo`, or a complete set of answer flags exits **2** with
    `Refusing to scaffold in a non-interactive run without complete input.
    Pass --yes to accept defaults, --dry-run to preview, or provide every
    answer as a flag. Missing: --…` (previously: an Ink render attempt against
    a pipe). A CI invocation like `summon component react | tee log` must now
    pass `--yes` (accept defaults), `--dry-run` (preview only), or every
    remaining flag.
  - **Excess positionals** exit **2** with `error: unexpected argument "X"`
    naming the first excess operand (plus a did-you-mean when ANY operand of
    the invocation — a bound positional included, not only the excess ones —
    names a sibling or child segment: `summon component react svelte MyThing`
    suggests `summon component svelte` off the bound `svelte`); they were
    previously commander's generic "too many arguments" or silently absorbed.
    Every other Commander parse failure — an unknown option, an unknown
    command, a missing option argument — now also exits **2** (aligned with
    `pragma`; commander's own exit **1** previously stood). The error text is
    unchanged — except an unknown segment beneath a namespace
    (`summon component reakt`), whose suggestion is now the shared
    `Did you mean 'summon component react'?` form both CLIs emit (previously
    commander's `(Did you mean react?)`); `--help`/`--version` keep exit 0,
    and a bare namespace still prints its help on stderr with exit 1.
  - **Invalid input**: an explicitly provided answer failing its prompt's own
    constraint (a `validate` rejection, or a value outside a select's
    choices) errors loudly (exit **2**) in every mode that reaches the
    generator — batch, run, and wizard; an incomplete non-interactive run
    REFUSES first, before validating — with a message echoing the value
    (`Invalid --component-path "not-pascal": …`). Batch runs
    (`--dry-run`/`--undo`) previously fell through to the interactive UI;
    `--yes` runs and partial-flag wizards previously accepted the invalid
    value and scaffolded a tree carrying it (e.g. `--name "Bad Name!"` wrote
    `./Bad Name!/` with the broken name in its package.json) — all four now
    refuse before any UI, exactly where `pragma create` validates. One
    prompt's VALUE SET also changed, not just when validation runs:
    `application/react`'s `--app-path` now rejects an absolute path and any
    `..` segment (previously ANY path was accepted and the tree was written
    wherever it pointed — a sibling app via `../my-app` included), matching
    `--component-path`'s long-standing rule. The batch
    modes additionally error (exit **2**) on a required answer that is
    missing even after defaults. A generator-raised cross-answer constraint
    (`invalidAnswersError` from `@canonical/summon-core`) fails the same
    way — a bare stderr line, exit **2** in the batch modes (previously an
    uncaught throw with a stack, exit 1); no shipped generator raises one
    today (application/react's former ssr/router guard is gone with its
    prompts — see the wizard note below). The run and wizard
    arms show it as the App's clean error instead of crashing — and now
    carry the same exit codes instead of exiting 0 with the failure
    rendered: exit **2** for the typed cross-answer error, exit **1** for
    any other failure the App reports (a mid-run write error, say). An ordinary
    `Error` thrown by a generator's `generate` gets the same treatment in
    every arm: the App's clean error phase (`GENERATE_ERROR`, exit **1**)
    where it previously crashed into Ink's boundary — rendered on stdout
    with a source frame and, under bun, exit **0** — and a bare stderr
    line (exit **1**) in the batch modes, where it previously escaped as
    an unhandled-rejection stack. A `generate()` that RETURNS no task (a
    plain-JS generator that forgot its `return`) is classified the same
    way — the named line `<generator>'s generate returned no task`, exit
    **1** in every arm — instead of the interpreter's incidental
    TypeError. For failures the App already reported, the rendering is
    unchanged; only the exit code moved.

  Also in this line of work, on a TTY: `--dry-run` renders the batch plan and
  `--undo` runs batch undo (neither mounts the interactive preview any more,
  and `--dry-run` now takes precedence over `--undo`); a run with PARTIAL
  answer flags asks exactly the missing prompts instead of silently
  defaulting the rest; and the long-missing `--undo` row appears in every
  generator's `--help`. Generated trees are byte-identical throughout; a
  `--yes` run with VALID answers is untouched (an invalid explicit answer
  now refuses — see *Invalid input* above).

* **`application/react` drops its `ssr` and `router` prompts — SSR and the
  router are always on.** The scaffold has no SPA arm, so the two wizard
  questions (`Include SSR?`, `Include router?`) only ever accepted their
  default: answering "no" hit the generator's own guard. Worse, the pair made
  the non-interactive refusal's advice unfollowable — a default-`true`
  confirm can be provided explicitly only as its negation, which the guard
  then rejected, so `summon application react` had no complete-flags path at
  all. The wizard now asks four questions (directory, forms, relay, install);
  `--no-ssr`/`--no-router` are unknown options (they previously only ever
  produced the guard error); the guard itself is gone as dead code. Generated
  trees are byte-identical — the pair never reached a template.

# [0.34.0](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/compare/v0.33.0...v0.34.0) (2026-08-21)


* refactor(cli)!: removals & fold — tier and block go through the story compiler, token add-config removed, cli-core folded into summon (#939) ([11d76c8](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/11d76c83667c3f76e543c0d6dfc1f0c99f29bd3b)), closes [#939](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/939) [#761](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/761) [#939](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/939) [#909](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/909)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `pragma tier lookup <name>` is removed; the verb is now
the tier story's compiled lookup `pragma tier lookup <name...>`. The
`tier_lookup` MCP tool takes `name: string[]` (was `name: string`) and
returns the uniform lookup envelope `{ results, errors }` (was a single
`{ uri, name, blocks }` object); its completion offers prefixed-IRI
candidates. The `--format llm`/plain output follows the generic lookup
renderers.

* refactor(cli)!: block list is the block story's declared, unfiltered list

L-OPEN-9 (PRA-111): `block list` was the last hand-written data verb, and the
filtering it existed for — the configured tier's parent CHAIN, the release
CHANNEL, and the `--all-tiers` escape from the first — is something the
declared-content grammar has no term for. The owner ruling is removal, not
grammar growth: the block story in pragma.conf.ts gains the `list` half and
`capabilities/block/` is deleted wholesale, `tierChain.ts` (and its
`CHANNEL_RELEASES` table, which had no other consumer) with it. `block` leaves
the authored registry and flows in through the unclaimed-stories half like
`standard` and `modifier`; only `token` remains a composite.

SIGNED-OFF VISIBLE CONSEQUENCE, verbatim: `block list` now lists ALL blocks,
including experimental/alpha ones, for everyone, until filtering returns in
declared form.

Display parity moved INTO the SPARQL rather than being reimplemented in
TypeScript: `VALUES ?class` closes the type set, so the BINDs that derive
`name` (COALESCE of `ds:name` and the IRI's local name — the old
`row.name ?? localName(...)` fallback), `type` (LCASE of the class local name —
the old `normalizeType`) and `tier` (the tier IRI's local name) operate over
known shapes. The `standard` story is the precedent for that technique. The
tier join stays OPTIONAL, so the untiered block A2 fixed stays visible — in the
ONE view that now exists.

D10-A ruled: block-list empty semantics follow the declared family. MEASURED
FIRST at the dispatch seam the compiled binary uses (`executeVerb`, pinned in
journeys.defaultPack.test.ts): `makeListRun` returns `[]` and never throws on
emptiness, so an empty store still exits 0 with `{ ok: true, data: [] }` —
IDENTICAL to the hand-written verb, which also returned an empty array. There
is NO exit-code delta. The only change is the empty-state MESSAGE, which can no
longer name a tier, a channel, or an `--all-tiers` escape; the story's
`emptyRecovery` supplies "No blocks in the store. Build it from the configured
design-system packs. Run `pragma sources update`." Recorded in the CHANGELOG row.

Covenant change (deliberate, the L-OPEN-9 `$comment` clause extended
chronologically after C1's): `block_list` loses its `--all-tiers` flag, so the
emitted verb has no flags and the MCP tool takes no input. Tool COUNT is
unchanged (37 stays 38 until C3).

CONFIG HONESTY — the fields are KEPT, their claims are not. Removing
`config.tier`/`config.channel` would be a second, unrequested breaking change,
so they stay accepted and reported; what changes is every place that promised
they scope something:
- `emitReference.ts`'s field docs now say `tier` is accepted and SCOPES NOTHING
  (reported by `config show`/`info` only) and `channel` selects the npm dist-tag
  `upgrade`/`info` read, nothing more (`docs/reference/config.md` regenerated);
- `config show`'s "(none — all tiers visible)" placeholder becomes "(none)":
  with no tier filter, "all tiers visible" is true of every value, not just the
  unset one;
- the `capabilities` catalog's `model` convention stops telling agents data is
  tier/channel-SCOPED and says the hierarchy is DATA on each entity, reads are
  unscoped, and `graph_query` is the way to filter;
- `block_list`/`config_show` tool hints follow;
- a new PARITY_GAPS entry (`block-list-unfiltered`) records the gap and its
  owner sign-off in the append-only ledger, and the two entries that described
  the hand-written verb are corrected rather than deleted.

PROTECTED updates, each replacing a dying assert with the new contract:
- surface.test.ts re-pins the flagless emitted verb;
- staleCommands.test.ts BANS `--all-tiers` in every shipped doc, so the retired
  flag cannot come back through prose (the same treatment `--llm` got);
- toolDescriptions.test.ts widens its `block_list` leak assert from the literal
  `--all-tiers` (now vacuous) to "no CLI flag of any name" — the failure a
  re-authored story `toolDescription` could reintroduce;
- collect.ts/collect.test.ts's reserved-noun rationale drops `block` from the
  composites it names (the mechanism is unchanged: every static noun is still
  reserved, derived from `staticModules`).

Tests: `capabilities/block/{parity,blockList}.test.ts` are replaced by
`capabilities/block.parity.test.ts` (the standard-noun fixture-parity pattern
C1 established for `tier`), which keeps every `block lookup` content-parity
assert byte-for-byte and adds the list half: all-blocks membership, the
SPARQL-derived row shape against the old hand-built one, the untiered block,
config-independence, and the measured empty-list semantics. The behavioral
journeys re-pin the NEW contract instead of dropping asserts — journeys.cli
(B9) now proves the same graph under four different tier/channel configs
returns ONE answer (a strictly stronger claim than the four different answers
it used to enumerate), journeys.defaultPack asserts exact whole-pack sets where
it previously had to filter the untiered block out to stay tolerant, and the
eval seed's channel case is inverted into `content-block-list-is-channel-
independent`, asserting the beta-gated block is visible on the normal channel.

Docs regenerated (`bun run gen:reference`: commands.md, tools.md, config.md);
getting-started.md and the storybook-hub CLI page describe the unfiltered list.
Gates: check, 1090 tests, perf budgets 8/8, build.
* `pragma block list --all-tiers` is removed — the CLI rejects
the flag as unknown, and the `block_list` MCP tool no longer accepts an
`allTiers` parameter (it takes no input at all). `block list` no longer filters
by the configured tier chain or release channel: it returns every block in the
store, experimental and alpha ones included. `config.tier` consequently scopes
nothing anywhere in the CLI, and `config.channel` retains only its npm dist-tag
role for `upgrade`/`info`; both fields are still accepted and reported. Row
shape, ordering and exit codes are unchanged.

* refactor(cli)!: token add-config is removed, not ported

L-OPEN-9 (PRA-111), the third and last removal: `token add-config` writes a
`tokens.config.mjs` starter file for the terrazzo pipeline. That is a MUTATION,
and the declared-content grammar the read surface is now built from
deliberately has no verb for one. The owner ruling is that a command the
grammar cannot express is removed rather than kept as code, so the verb is
deleted — not reimplemented, not deprecated, no window.

With it goes the LAST authored data module: `capabilities/token/` is empty and
gone, so `token` joins `block` and `tier` as a purely declarative noun and the
authored registry is now the kernel's own nouns and nothing else. That is
PRA-111's end state reached: zero hand-written data commands, a fork defines
its entire read surface in `pragma.conf.ts`. (C4 adds the machine check that
holds it there.)

Covenant change (deliberate, the L-OPEN-9 `$comment` clause extended
chronologically after C1's and C2's): the `token` noun drops its `add-config`
verb and `mcpSurface.tools` drops `token_add-config` — 38 → 37, the first
tool-count DECREASE in the covenant's history (AV-228 B3's 41→38 was the last
change of any direction).

Kept deliberately: `mutationContract` in the FIXED section is untouched. The
plan-first/confirm gate is a kernel contract, not this verb's, and
`sources_update`, `config_set`, `upgrade` and the `create_*` verbs still stand
behind it.

PROTECTED updates, each replacing a dying assert with the new contract:
- surface.test.ts pins `token`'s three read verbs, and both closing-direction
  guards (`surface.test.ts`'s emitted==covenant and
  `surfaceConformance.test.ts`'s frozen-tool count) move to 37 — the count is
  the point of those asserts, so it is edited, not loosened;
- the hints↔tools drift guard forced the `hints.ts` entry's removal, exactly as
  designed: a stale hint naming a dead tool fails CI;
- staleCommands.test.ts BANS `token add-config`/`token_add-config` in every
  shipped doc, which is what caught the two prose sites below;
- collect.test.ts's "leaves a composite noun's verbs intact" case becomes
  "leaves a DECLARED noun's shipped verbs intact": the package-claim mechanics
  it guards are unchanged and still asserted against the real registry, but the
  thing at risk is now the story's own verbs — the case that still matters,
  since after this commit every data noun is story-backed;
- collect.ts's reserved-noun rationale no longer justifies itself by a
  hand-written verb (the mechanism — every static noun reserved, derived from
  `staticModules` — is unchanged).

Eval seed: the two `token_add-config` cases are INVERTED rather than dropped,
so the removal is pinned instead of merely un-asserted —
`tool-token-noun-is-read-only` asserts the tool is absent and the token noun
exposes exactly its three reads, and `prompt-tokens-config-maps-to-nothing`
asserts that "generate a terrazzo tokens config" now maps to NO tool at all
(the point of the ruling: an agent finds nothing claiming to do it). The
plan-first MECHANIC the deleted case exercised stays covered by
`tool-config-set-is-plan-first` and `tool-upgrade-is-plan-first`.

Docs regenerated (`bun run gen:reference`: commands.md, tools.md, index.md);
architecture.md's "three DOMAIN verbs the story grammar cannot express" and
config-model.md's composite clause are corrected here because the stale-command
gate makes them red — the remaining composite framing is C4's sweep.
Gates: check, 1087 tests, perf budgets 8/8, build.
* `pragma token add-config` is removed and so is the
`token_add-config` MCP tool; the designed MCP tool count drops from 38 to 37.
Nothing in the CLI generates `tokens.config.mjs` any more — write it by hand or
drive terrazzo directly. The `token` noun keeps `list`, `lookup` and `sample`,
unchanged.

* docs(cli): the composite framing is retired, and a guard replaces it

C1-C3 removed the last three hand-written data verbs, so every place that
explained the CLI as "stories PLUS a few hand-written verbs" now describes a
shape that no longer exists. This sweeps that framing and — the point of the
commit — replaces the prose with a machine check, because prose is exactly what
went stale.

New PROTECTED assert in `distribution.test.ts`: for every noun `pragma.conf.ts`
declares, the REGISTERED capability module (what the CLI, the MCP server and
the generated reference all project) must be its compiled story and nothing
else. Two halves, because a compiled spec carries closures a second compile
cannot reproduce by identity:

- SHAPE — recompiling the story ALONE must yield the same verbs with the same
  declared shape (path, summary, doc, params, capability, examples), so an
  extra verb or an extra flag beside the story fails;
- IDENTITY — each registered verb must BE the story's compiled verb object.
  A composite module (`[...story.verbs, handWrittenVerb]`, exactly how `block`,
  `token` and `tier` were built until this PR) constructs new objects, so it
  cannot pass even if its shapes happen to match.

That is the checkable form of PRA-111's end state — "a fork defines its entire
read surface in pragma.conf.ts" — and it fails on re-introduction, not on
review.

Framing swept, each site now saying what is true:
- `capabilities/distribution.ts` and `capabilities/index.ts` (the latter in C3):
  no data noun is authored, so a declared story IS the whole noun;
- `kernel/packs/types.ts`: `list` is optional so a pack can serve a noun that is
  addressable but not enumerable — not because a noun's list "stays
  hand-written";
- `kernel/copy.test.ts`: the `src/capabilities/**` exclusion is justified by the
  kernel nouns' runtime copy, and notes that the `ds:` residue it was written
  for is gone;
- `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/config-model.md` (both in C3, forced by the
  stale-command gate) plus config-model's read-story definition here;
- `testing/fixtures/graph/canonical.ts`: the tier-scoped and channel-gated
  blocks now serve the OPPOSITE purpose — they are what prove the declared list
  hides neither;
- `testing/behavioral/README.md`: the `journeys.cli.test.ts` row describes the
  journey it now is.

The "hardcoded five-noun list" PRA-111 carries as an addendum needed nothing
here: it was already structurally retired (`collect.ts` derives the reserved set
from `staticModules`), and C3 retired the last of its prose residue.

Left alone deliberately: "hand-authored"/"hand-written" where it is still true
and about something else — `pragma.conf.ts` as hand-authored data, the
hand-written docs `docExamples.test.ts` scans, the PARITY_GAPS entry saying
there are no hand-authored render templates, and GraphQL's `CompositeType`.
Chronological `$comment` and PARITY_GAPS records keep their historical wording;
those ledgers are append-only.

Gates: check, 1088 tests, build.

* test(summon): the byte-equality guarantee becomes a named conformance suite

L-OPEN-10 (PRA-121) item 2. Both product binaries generate the same tree from
* the `@canonical/cli-core` package is deleted and no longer
published. Import the surviving symbols from `@canonical/summon-core` under the
same names — `runGeneratorTask`, `createGeneratorStamp`,
`createStampOnEffectStart`, `answerPromptWithDefaults`, `buildReplayCommand`,
`formatContentPreview`, `formatEffectLine`, `formatEffectWithContent`,
`formatLlmHelp`, `formatLlmJson`, `formatLlmMarkdown`, `getActionColor`,
`getActionLabel`, `getEffectPayload`, `getLanguageHint`, `getLlmActionLabel`,
`getLlmEffectPath`, `isVisibleEffect` — except `promptForAnswers`, which is
`collectAnswers`. The v1 command model (`CommandDefinition`, `registerAll`,
`formatHelp`/`formatNounHelp`/`formatVerbHelp`/`formatVerbList`,
`buildCompleters`, `resolveCompletion`, `createOutputAdapter`,
`createExitResult`, `createOutputResult`, `generatorToCommand`,
`promptToParameter`, `executeGenerator`) is removed with no successor in any
published package.

* feat(summon): the generator definition is summon's versioned domain spec

L-OPEN-10 (PRA-121) item 3. The shape of a generator was described only by
TypeScript interfaces inside this package, so a consumer outside TypeScript had
nothing to read, and a change to the shape left no trace anyone could diff.
`spec/generator-definition.v1.schema.json` writes it down, versioned: a
backwards-incompatible change gets a v2 file beside this one, never an edit
here. The file ships (added to `files`), so it is readable from an installed
package rather than only from the repo.

What it is NOT, stated IN the artifact rather than only in a commit message:
the schema's top-level `$comment` carries the owner's ruling verbatim — the
shared contract is not the generator definition, it is the general command
types seam and the compositional logic — and says explicitly that this file
does not describe, and must not be taken to describe, the contract between a
CLI kernel and its commands. Extracting that seam is a separate program with
its own ADR, and nothing here claims it. Anyone who finds the file finds the
scope; a drift-guard case asserts both sentences are still there.

Declarative projection only. `generate`, and a prompt's `when`/`validate`, are
functions the module carries and JSON cannot. The schema DECLARES them anyway,
marked `CODE-CARRIED, not data` with `type: "null"`, rather than omitting them
— an omission would read as "a generator has no generate", which is the more
misleading of the two.

Drift guard, ajv-FREE and deliberately so (`src/types/schema.test.ts`): a
validator would prove some example document satisfies the schema, which is not
the failure worth guarding. The failure is a field added to or renamed in
`GeneratorDefinition`/`GeneratorMeta`/`PromptDefinition` while the published
schema keeps describing the old shape. So the check is on KEY SETS, pinned to
the interfaces with `satisfies Record<keyof T, unknown>`: adding an interface
field breaks compilation of the test's key literal first, and the runtime
assertion then fails until the JSON is updated too. Two mechanical steps,
neither skippable — and no new dependency in a package every generator author
installs. The schema is read from disk exactly as a consumer would read it, so
malformed JSON fails here rather than at a downstream tool.

Gates: summon-core check + 422 tests at 100% coverage.

* docs(cli): the tool is the tool, not a next generation of one

L-OPEN-10 (PRA-121) item 4. Two places still described `pragma` as a successor
rather than as itself, and both are read by someone outside the repo:

- `packages/cli/pragma/package.json`'s description — "Next-generation CLI and
  MCP kernel for Canonical's design system (pragma v2)" — is what npm shows on
  the package page and in search results. It now says what the tool IS: "CLI and
  MCP server over Canonical's design-system knowledge graph", matching the
  README's opening sentence.
- the covenant's `bins.pragma` string — "pragma v2 CLI and MCP server host
  (stdio)" — is the frozen description of the binary.

D11-A ruled that the covenant string changes on BOTH sides, so the edit lands in
`surface/surface.v2.json` AND in `emitSurface.ts`'s FIXED_SURFACE (the two must
mirror each other verbatim; `surface.test.ts` fails if they do not), with a
`$comment` clause recording the change and its reasoning.

Kept, deliberately: every chronological `v2` record in the covenant `$comment`
and in PARITY_GAPS. Those ledgers are append-only history — rewriting them to
remove a word would be the same class of dishonesty this PR keeps closing. The
`surface.v2.json` FILENAME is likewise unchanged: it is a wire identity with a
consumer contract, and renaming it is not framing work. The internal docblocks
that contrast a v1 mechanism with its v2 replacement (the error kernel's exit
model, the pack `version: 2` enrichment fields, the grammar's disclosure-level
normalization) also stay: they are accurate statements about where a design came
from, not a claim about what the product is.

Measured before and after: "next-generation" now appears nowhere in this
package, and the only remaining `pragma v2` strings are the historical records
named above.

Gates: pragma check, 1089 tests, build, docs regenerated (no byte moved — the
reference pages never carried either string).
