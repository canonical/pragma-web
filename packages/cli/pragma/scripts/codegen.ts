/**
 * The committed-codegen generator the build runs (`scripts/build.ts` is
 * the one caller in a build; the gate-seam unit pins in
 * src/testing/perf/codegen.test.ts are the other importers). Extracted from
 * build.ts so the CHECK seam — the mechanism that keeps a gate's build from
 * silently repairing a stale committed module before the PROTECTED drift
 * guards read it (create.test.ts's projection-fidelity and
 * reader-derivability cells) — is an importable, injectable function a
 * millisecond unit cell can drive, instead of two unpinned lines only a
 * real stale gate build would ever exercise. Importing this module runs NO
 * build and writes nothing: each generator acts only when called, and `out`
 * is injectable so a cell drives check mode against seeded bytes in a
 * tmpdir while `bun run build` keeps writing the committed modules.
 *
 * CHECK MODE (`{ check: true }` — a gate's build, PRAGMA_BUILD_SKIP_DOCS=1
 * in build.ts): COMPARE, never silently repair. A stale committed
 * `createSurface.generated.ts` FAILS loudly, naming the module and
 * `bun run build` as the repair. The gate must judge the bytes git actually
 * holds, so repairing them in the same run that checks them would green a
 * stale tree and hide the drift the guard exists to surface.
