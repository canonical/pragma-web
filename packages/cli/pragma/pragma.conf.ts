 */
const DESIGN_SYSTEM_COLOPHON = `The Canonical design system is a **knowledge graph**, not a component library.
Every block, token, modifier, standard, and tier is a node in an RDF store,
described by the \`ds:\` ontology and queried the same way whether you reach it
over GraphQL or raw SPARQL.

## What the graph models

- **Blocks** — components, patterns, layouts, and subcomponents (the \`ds:UIBlock\`
  family). A block carries its anatomy, guidelines, and \`when to use\` / \`when
  not to use\` narrative as graph properties, not prose in a wiki.
- **Modifiers** — families of variant values (\`ds:hasModifierFamily\` →
  \`ds:hasModifier\`) a block composes, so a variant is a relationship, not a
  string.
- **Tokens** — the themeable design values, resolved per theme.
- **Standards** — the do / don't coding guidance, categorized and linked to the
  blocks they govern.
- **Concepts** — the long-form documentation that belongs to no single block:
  foundations, decision guides, and how-to guides, each typed by a
  \`ds:ConceptType\`.
- **Implementations** — which library implements which block, in which
  framework, with a source link pinned to the release that shipped it: the
  spec and the code realizing it are edges in one graph.

## How it fits together

- **Tiers** are a hierarchy (\`global\` > \`apps\` > \`apps/lxd\`): a lower tier
  inherits and overrides the blocks of its ancestors, so scoping a query to a
  tier walks that chain.
- **Channels** (\`normal\`, \`experimental\`, \`prerelease\`) gate visibility, so an
  in-progress block never leaks into a stable answer.

## Why RDF

One graph makes every relationship first-class and queryable: \`block lookup\`
follows edges to modifiers and subcomponents, \`concept lookup\` reads the
long-form documentation, \`graph query\` runs arbitrary SPARQL, and
\`ontology lookup\` reads the schema itself. Which React components implement
a global-tier block is one query, not an afternoon. The store is built once
by \`sources update\` and addressed by content hash, so the domain you query is
exactly the domain that was published.`;

/**
 * The read stories the design-system pack supplies — `block`, `token`,
 * `variable`, `modifier` and `tier` as declared data rather than code.
 *
 * `token` and `variable` read the TOKEN-ONTOLOGY pack's four strata rather than
 * this one's graph, and they are declared here anyway, deliberately: `token
 * consumers` joins a symbol to the design-system records that consume it, so
 * the pair spans both packs and there is no single pack whose `stories/*.json`
 * could carry them. The day the strata are addressable without the design
 * system — or the day either pack ships its own stories — is the day to split
 * them out, and the note below about deletion applies to whichever half moves.
 *
 * The association with the pack is the point: when `@canonical/design-system`
 * starts shipping its own `stories/*.json`, this block is deleted and the
 * package tier takes over with no code change here or anywhere else. The local
 * `readonly PackDefinition[]` annotation is what type-checks them —
 * `PackSource.stories` is deliberately `readonly unknown[]`, because the config
 * layer does not know the pack grammar (`parsePackDefinition` does).

  // `block list` is declared content (L-OPEN-9): one unfiltered SELECT over
  // the four UIBlock classes, listing ALL blocks — experimental and alpha ones
  // included, for everyone — until filtering returns in declared form. The
  // hand-written tier-chain/channel filtering (and its `--all-tiers` escape)
  // is removed with the code, an owner-signed consequence. Display parity
  // lives IN the query: `VALUES ?class` closes the type set, so the BINDs
  // that derive `name` (declared name, else the IRI's local name), `type`
  // (lowercased class local name), and `tier` (tier IRI's local name) operate
  // over known shapes — the `standard` story's BIND/COALESCE precedent.
  //
  // `block lookup` is served over the GraphQL fetch path (ONE generated document
  // over the `UIBlock` interface covering Component/Pattern/Layout/Subcomponent).
  // Base level mirrors the old summary view (name/tier/summary); the default is
  // `detailed`, matching the old CLI which rendered anatomy and modifiers
  // without a flag. A derived name that maps onto no schema field is omitted
  // (OPTIONAL parity), so a graph missing one of these properties degrades
  // gracefully rather than erroring.
  //
  // That graceful degradation is also how this story went silent: it used to
  // read `ds:whenToUse`/`ds:whenNotToUse`, which the ontology RETIRED in favour
  // of a single `ds:usage` — "Subsumes the former whenToUse/whenNotToUse" is
  // that property's own skos:definition. The shipped pack asserts `ds:usage` on
  // all 264 blocks and neither retired term on any of them, so every
  // `block lookup` on every install rendered no usage narrative at all —
  // silently, because a name that maps onto no schema field is exactly the case
  // OPTIONAL parity swallows. The retired terms are NOT kept as a fallback:
  // `ds:usage` subsumes them, so a pack carrying both would print the same
  // guidance twice, and a declaration no shipped graph can satisfy is
  // untestable by construction — which is what let the silence ship.
  // `block.shipped.exec.test.ts` now holds every graph term declared here — the
  // identity property, fields, sections, expand relations, and every term
  // selected beneath them, walked recursively — to being DEFINED as a property
  // by the SHIPPED ontology. Defined, not asserted, and the difference is the
  // whole point: a term the ontology never defines is a story bug that can
  // never render, on any block, on any install — this defect. A term it defines
  // that no instance asserts yet (`ds:figmaLink` today) is a content gap
  // upstream, which the OPTIONAL parity above degrades over gracefully and
  // which this pack has no business failing on. `ds:usage` alone is ALSO held
  // to being asserted, on every block, because its absence is what shipped.
  //
  // Disclosure declares the FULL canonical ladder `[summary, standard,
  // detailed]` — the same set `standard` declares — so a config
  // `detail=standard` names a level `block` advertises rather than one it
  // silently accepts-then-degrades. Block carries no `standard`-tier content of
  // its own; gating is by canonical index, so `standard` resolves to the base
  // view. Only the level SET is aligned: the per-noun DEFAULT stays domain-tuned
  // (`block` rich-by-default, `standard` terse-by-default).

  // this pin an added or renamed upstream file can silently compact every `ds:`
  // entity to the wrong prefix, and `block list` stops resolving.
  //
  // (2) They are the domain half of the kernel's `DEFAULT_PREFIX_MAP`
  // (`src/kernel/render/prefixes.ts`) — what the CLI compacts in output AND
  // what it expands a user-typed `ds:Button` / `cs:rule` through before a
  // lookup. Drop a namespace here and its lookups stop resolving; that is why

/**
 * The domain terms the kernel reads this distribution's graph with.
 *
 * A separate export because it is NOT a config layer field: it is compiled in
 * and read at module load by `src/kernel/vocabulary.ts`, whose readers (the
 * storeless completion fast path, the pack index builder) cannot reach a config
 * layer at all. Layering it would let a project config set it and change
 * nothing. A fork edits these values and rebuilds; `parseVocabulary` type-checks
 * the shape and rejects a term that is not a prefixed name.
 *
 * Every prefix used here must be bound in `prefixes` above. `rdfs:label` and
 * `rdfs:comment` are deliberately absent — the kernel treats standard
 * vocabulary as universal.
 *
 * The `prompt` terms are a READ CONTRACT, not a claim about instances: this
 * distribution's graph currently carries no `ds:Prompt` entities at all, so
 * `prompt list` is honestly empty. Declaring the shape anyway is what makes an
 * empty result mean "the graph has none" rather than "nothing was declared".
