 * changes values, not code. The import is static because the surfaces that need
 * identity — `--help`, `__complete`, first-run onboarding, the MCP handshake —
 * all run before or without the config layer. That is safe precisely because
 * `pragma.conf.ts` is inert data: a plain object literal whose only import is a
 * type. It reaches no zod schema, no fs, no evaluator. `capabilities/lazy.test.ts`
 * pins that boundary, and `src/identity.test.ts` proves the projection.
 *
 * Also holds the stable cross-cutting enums: output formats here, and the
 * detail levels re-exported from `kernel/config/types.ts`, where the config
 * validator closes the `detail` field over them.
