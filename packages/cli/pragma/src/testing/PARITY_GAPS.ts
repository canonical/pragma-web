What is no longer true is that an UNMATCHED free-filter value stays successful: a value-free filter now rejects a value its vocabulary does not admit with INVALID_INPUT and the admissible values as `validOptions`, the same courtesy a declared-`values` filter always extended (`packs/sparql/filterValues.ts`). The vocabulary is the graph's, not the returned rows' — a filter declares where it lives (`PackFilter.vocabulary`), so a real value that happens to match no row (a category with zero standards, a `ds:ConceptType` no concept uses) is a calm empty list, and only a value the graph does not know is an error.",

      "CLOSED, by REVERSAL of the entry it used to be. This gap read: `block lookup` resolves by `ds:name` globally, a same-named block at two tiers cannot be disambiguated by plain name, address it by prefixed IRI instead. That was accepted while the answer was merely arbitrary; it stopped being acceptable once measured — 25 live block names are carried by 2–3 blocks, and EVERY one of them was answered with whichever IRI sorted first and no sign the others existed (`block lookup button` returned Launchpad's Button, because `apps_launchpad…` precedes `global…`). 'Address it by IRI' is not a recovery an agent can reach when nothing tells it there is a second block to address. Two things replace it, and neither is a change of arity — one name still answers with one entity, and a glob is still the declared multi-entity form. (1) The discard is no longer SILENT: the resolve is unlimited, the winner is answered with, and the IRIs it outranked ride the verb's `notice` — the same seam a zero-record read uses (stderr in plain mode, `meta.notice` on `--format json` and MCP), because an ambiguous hit is the same failure as an empty one, a result that misrepresents itself. `LookupOutput.ambiguous` carries them in `data` for the machine surfaces, and is ABSENT (not `[]`) when nothing was ambiguous, so every unambiguous read keeps the payload it had. Note the recovery is not reachable any other way: a glob expands over DISTINCT names, so `block lookup 'Butt*'` returned Launchpad's Button and ButtonLink and the global Button appeared nowhere. (2) The order is a declared, derived RANKING (`PackLookup.scopeWeight` in `pragma.conf.ts`, generated by `packs/sparql/buildLookupQuery.ts#rankingClause`): a tier's depth comes from the `/` count in its OWN `ds:name` (`\"Apps/Launchpad\"` → 2, never from the `_` in `ds:apps_launchpad`), and it MULTIPLIES the existing type weight rather than tiebreaking above it, so a whole component in a nested tier still outranks a global SUBcomponent (`TextInput`). Nothing is enumerated, so a tier added upstream is placed without an edit here; an asserted `ds:tierRank` would take precedence over the derived depth and retire the config declaration with no code change. WHAT REMAINS a gap: `lookup` is still not tier-SCOPED — there is no way to ask for one tier's answer only, the ranking merely decides which comes first — and since L-OPEN-9 nothing is tier/channel-FILTERED (the hand-written `block list` went with its `tierChain.ts`; see `block-list-unfiltered`). Two top-level tiers still cannot be ordered against each other by depth alone, which today leaves `Navigation` (`global` vs `apps`) and `InfoTable` (`global` vs `sites`) decided by the IRI fallback; naming a precedence among the depth-1 tiers is an ontology question, deliberately NOT invented here.",
