/**
 * Read-noun eval seed cases (commit 4) — extends `cases/stable.ts` once PR3's
 * read nouns are live. Representative, NOT exhaustive (PR7 populates the full
 * MCP eval matrix); each case builds its OWN fixture via `bootFixtureRuntime`
 * so it stays independent of `eval.test.ts`'s shared env.
 *
 * Anchor VALUES (Button, `importance`->`primary`, `code/function/purity`, 4
 * components) come from the ported canonical fixture graph
 * (`testing/fixtures/graph/canonical.ts`), which THIS package controls — not
 * from PR3's noun/verb/tool SET, which is read from the live surface
 * elsewhere (`liveReadSurface.ts`) per R2.
