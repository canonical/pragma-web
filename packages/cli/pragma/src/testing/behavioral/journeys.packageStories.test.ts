/**
 * The package tier, end to end: a noun the distribution never shipped.
 *
 * A package that ships `stories/*.json` and is declared as a `file:` pack
 * contributes a working command to a project that declares it — resolved by
 * `sources update`, hashed into the pack, written into the pack directory, read
 * back storelessly at dispatch, and answered from the fixture graph. Proven both
 * in-process and through the SHIPPED entry in a real subprocess.
 *
 * The same package also ships a malformed story and a schema-invalid one. Those
 * must be DROPPED, not fatal: package stories reach dispatch before the command
 * tree exists, so a throw there fails every command — including `sources update`
 * and `doctor`, the only two that can recover from it. Both of those are run
 * here after the bad stories are in the pack.
