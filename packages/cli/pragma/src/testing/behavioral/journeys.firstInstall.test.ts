/**
 * The first-install journey — this PR's whole point, pinned.
 *
 * A machine with no cache, no pointer, no network and an empty cwd must answer
 * real store-backed reads from the embedded pack, and must say honestly where
 * those answers come from. Equally: a project that declared its OWN packs and
 * never built them must NOT be handed the distribution's graph — it is a
 * different graph, and quietly serving it is the failure the boot decision
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Assertions pin MEMBERSHIP, never counts: the row counts move whenever the
 * upstream design system does, but a design system with no `Button`, or a tier
 * hierarchy with no `Global`, is a change a human should be made to look at.
