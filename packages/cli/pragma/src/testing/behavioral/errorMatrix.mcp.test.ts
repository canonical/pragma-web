/**
 * B3 — the error/recovery MATRIX, fixture-backed half: per-read-noun lookup
 * misses, an empty-filtered list, and `ontology_show`'s bad-prefix error.
 * Parameterized over `liveReadSurface.ts` — never a hard-coded noun.
 *
 * TWO ADAPTATIONS from the plan's wording, both verified empirically against
 * the live kernel (not assumed):
 *
 * 1. `<noun>_lookup` on a SINGLE or ALL-unknown batch FAILS the call
 *    (`ok:false, error.code==="ENTITY_NOT_FOUND"`) — `makeLookupRun` throws on
 *    a total miss; only a PARTIAL batch reports the miss while staying
 *    `ok:true` (that shape is B1's job, `agentSession.mcp.test.ts`). See
 *    PARITY_GAPS `single-lookup-miss-fails-batch-partial-reports`.
 * 2. A filtered list narrowed to zero rows is `{ok:true, data:[]}` — there is
 *    still no `meta.count` field on any read envelope, which is the divergence
 *    `read-meta-always-empty` now records (it no longer claims `meta` is always
 *    `{}`: a zero-record read carries the list's own `notice` as
 *    `meta.notice` on both machine surfaces, asserted below).
 * 3. A value-free filter given a value its vocabulary does not admit is
 *    INVALID_INPUT, not a successful empty list — the narrowing recorded in
 *    PARITY_GAPS `no-empty-hook-on-free-filter`. Emptiness itself is still a
 *    success: a value the GRAPH admits but no row carries (a category with zero
 *    standards) is a calm empty list, asserted below.

 * filter could tell a typo from an empty answer. It could: the rows it is
 * filtering carry the vocabulary. Over MCP the old shape made a mistyped
 * `--category`, an unbuilt store and a genuinely empty category byte-identical —
 * the silence a model has no way to recover from.
 *
 * A value the graph does not know is now INVALID_INPUT with the admissible
 * values as `validOptions`, exactly as a filter declaring `values` has always
 * behaved; the difference is that the vocabulary is READ FROM THE GRAPH rather
 * than copied into the story. Zero rows for a value that DOES exist stays a calm
 * empty list — that is a real answer, not a bad argument — and "exists" means
 * the graph declares it, not that some returned row happened to carry it.
