/**
 * Serialize an entity's neighbourhood as Turtle — the dense form of the read.
 *
 * The JSON projection is faithful but expensive: one named node costs about 95
 * bytes of wrapper to convey thirteen characters, and that overhead is paid per
 * term. Measured on one button, structure alone was ~6.1 KB of a 15.8 KB read.
 * Turtle spends the prefixes ONCE and then writes each term as itself.
 *
 * It is not merely shorter — it is the shape this data already has:
 *
 * - IRI versus literal is SYNTAX (`ds:Foo` against `"Foo"`), which is the whole
 *   thing the typed-term projection had to carry a `termType` field to say.
 * - A blank node is `[ … ]` inline, which is exactly the record the reader
 *   assembles by hand for the JSON form.
 * - Datatypes and language tags are native (`"x"@en`, `"2026-02-20"^^xsd:date`).
 * - An inbound edge is just a triple written the other way round. The whole
 *   `InboundGroup` structure exists only because JSON cannot point an arrow
 *   backwards.
 *
 * Counts, samples and truncations ride as `#` comments. That is not a fallback:
 * a comment is the one place a serialization can say something ABOUT the data
 * without asserting it as data, and a reader — human or model — takes it the
 * same way.
 *
 * Pure: it reads only the projection it is handed, so the same neighbourhood
 * always renders the same bytes.
