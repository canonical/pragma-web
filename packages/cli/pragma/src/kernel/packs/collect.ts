/**
 * Assemble the EFFECTIVE capability modules at dispatch.
 *
 * The `--help`/`__complete` fast paths use the STATIC capabilities (the
 * authored modules plus the stories `pragma.conf.ts` declares, compiled at
 * module load) only. When a real command runs, this merges in the stories the
 * PROJECT declares: one may override a story-backed noun (replacing that
 * module) or introduce a new one; one that claims an authored, non-story noun
 * (config, ontology, …) is a hard error, and any surviving `(noun, verb)`
 * collision is caught by uniqueness.
 *
 * Precedence is config > package > static, and within config the closer
 * declaration wins: `packs[].stories` (the story a declared pack supplies) is
 * overridden by the top-level `stories` (the project's own, most specific,
 * statement). PACKAGE stories — the `stories/*.json` the answering pack carries
 * — are third-party data, so they go through {@link validateStories}, which
 * drops a bad one with a reported problem, CANNOT throw, and lets a package
 * ADD a noun but never replace one the CLI ships. Config stories stay fatal and
 * may override: the user owns those, and a broken `pragma.config.ts` already
 * fails every command.
 *
 * zod is reached only through {@link parsePackDefinition} (lazy) — this module
 * is imported at dispatch, never on the fast path, so validating config stories
 * costs nothing on `--help`/`__complete`.
