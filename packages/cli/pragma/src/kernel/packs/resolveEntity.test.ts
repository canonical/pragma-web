/**
 * Lookup ADDRESSING (PROTECTED): which argument shapes a pack lookup accepts,
 * and whether the answer is the same twice.
 *
 * A lookup's `<name...>` positional is documented — in the generated reference,
 * in the MCP tool schema, and by shell completion, which offers prefixed IRIs
 * and nothing else — as accepting a name, a prefixed name, an absolute IRI, or
 * a glob. These assert that the resolver honours the shape it is handed rather
 * than the source its pack declares, that an entity is addressable by IRI even
 * when it carries no `by` value, that a name reaches its entity through the
 * whitespace either side may be padded with, and that an ambiguous name answers
 * with the same entity on every store and every machine — while NAMING the ones
 * it did not answer with.
 *
 * That last clause is a REVERSAL, signed off by the owner. It used to read "an
 * ambiguous name resolves to the SAME entity every time", and the suite proved
 * it: a total `ORDER BY` under a `LIMIT 1` does make the answer reproducible.
 * It just made it reproducibly SILENT — `block lookup button` answered with
 * Launchpad's Button on every machine, because `apps_launchpad…` sorts before
 * `global…`, and nothing in the payload said the global one existed. The arity
 * is unchanged and deliberately so; what the old assertions took for the whole
 * property, determinism, was only half of it.
