/**
 * Compile a list story's declared filters, its search term, its tier scope and
 * one page's bounds into the SPARQL the store actually runs.
 *
 * WHY IN THE QUERY. Filters used to be predicates over the rows a query had
 * already returned. That was injection-safe and order-preserving — the two
 * properties this module has to keep — but it put filtering on the wrong side
 * of any cap: a `LIMIT` in a story's own text truncates BEFORE the filter runs,
 * so `--category testing` over a capped population answers from whatever
 * happened to be inside the window. Nothing was being truncated yet, because no
 * story declared a cap and the kernel had none to declare; the moment one
 * exists, every declared filter starts deciding over a truncated population.
 * Pagination is that cap, so the two move together and they move inward.
 *
 * The TIER SCOPE is here for that reason and not by analogy: it narrows the
 * 252-row `block list` under a 300-row page today, so a page that started
 * truncating would decide the default scope by where the window fell. It is the
 * one clause that constrains the ENTITY rather than a projected cell — see
 * {@link ListTierScope}.
 *
 * ONE SHAPE, ALWAYS. The author query becomes a sub-select inside a wrapping
 * SELECT that carries the predicates and the page bounds — whether or not there
 * is anything to filter. It has to be a wrap rather than an appended `HAVING`
 * when there IS something: a `match: "set"` filter reads a cell the author's own
 * `GROUP BY` computed (`standard list`'s `GROUP_CONCAT`), so the predicate can
 * only run after aggregation, and the cap only after the predicate.
 *
 * It is a wrap when there is NOTHING to filter, too, and that is a correction.
 * Appending `LIMIT n` to the author's own text is a syntax error for every
 * story whose text already ends in a solution modifier or a trailing `VALUES`
 * block — `LIMIT` after `LIMIT`, after `OFFSET`, after `VALUES` — and because
 * the page has a DEFAULT, that error fired on every call rather than only on
 * paged ones. The shortcut existed to keep the store running, character for
 * character, the query it ran before. Measured over all nine shipped bodies
 * (median of 15 warm store queries per body, both texts, 2026-09-10) the wrap
 * ran between 2.7 ms FASTER and 0.5 ms slower, deltas straddling zero and the
 * one clear win being `block list`, the 252-row body; every body's rows came
 * back byte-identical through the wrap, key order included. So the shortcut
 * bought nothing measurable and cost a whole class of author query. Keeping it
 * would have meant a guard recognising every trailing-modifier shape the
 * grammar admits — more parsing than the wrap itself needs, to reach the
 * answer the wrap already gives.
 *
 * THE AUTHOR'S TEXT IS SPLIT, NEVER EDITED. Two parts of a query cannot live
 * inside a group graph pattern, and {@link ./authorQuery.readAuthorQuery} is
 * what tells them apart:
 *
 * - The PROLOGUE (`PREFIX`, `BASE`) is lifted to the wrapper's own prologue, in
 *   the author's order. That is a split at the `SELECT` keyword, not a rewrite:
 *   the body is a suffix of the author's text, byte for byte. A COLLIDING
 *   prefix resolves the way it always did — the store prepends the pack's own
 *   prefix map ahead of whatever it is handed, the author's declaration is
 *   emitted after it, and SPARQL's last declaration wins, so an author who
 *   redeclares `ds:` shadows the pack's `ds:` exactly as they did before any
 *   wrap existed (verified both shapes against the pinned oxigraph). The
 *   wrapper declares nothing and names no prefixed term, so it brings no
 *   prefix of its own for an author to collide with.
 * - A DATASET clause (`FROM`, `FROM NAMED`) is refused, at declaration and
 *   again here. It sits in the MIDDLE of the author's text rather than at its
 *   front, so lifting it would mean cutting a span out — an edit, not a split.
 *
 * The wrapper projects the author's own variables, in the author's own order
 * ({@link ./authorQuery}) — `SELECT *` in the wrapper would hand back
 * alphabetised binding keys and change every JSON answer's shape. An author who
 * wrote `SELECT *` themselves gets `SELECT *`, which is the same alphabetisation
 * twice and so preserves their key order; a FILTERABLE story that writes it is
 * refused, because a projection of `*` names nothing to constrain.
 *
 * USER INPUT IS BOUND, NOT SPLICED. Every value a caller supplies reaches the
 * query as a row of a `VALUES` block — the closest thing the store's text-only
 * interface has to a bound parameter — escaped by
 * {@link ./escape.escapeSparqlString}, and the predicate compares against that
 * variable rather than against interpolated text. The `VALUES` block sits
 * inside `FILTER EXISTS` deliberately: joined into the outer group it would
 * MULTIPLY rows, and a repeated flag over a `set` cell carrying two of the
 * requested members would return that row twice.
 *
 * The comparison itself is the row predicate's, transposed:
 * case-insensitively equal for `exact`, membership of a whitespace-separated
 * set for `set`, substring for search, and a cell that is unbound or empty
 * never matches. One divergence is worth naming: the row predicate NFC-
 * normalised both sides, and SPARQL has no normaliser, so the graph's own
 * spelling is compared as it is stored (the caller's side is still normalised,
 * in {@link ./filterValues}).

 *   vocabulary grows a multi-word term.
 * - An EMPTY value matches an EMPTY cell, because `CONTAINS(" ", " ")` is true.
 *   The row predicate answered false on an empty cell, and the `exact` branch

 *
 * THE UNTIERED HALF IS NOT A COURTESY. `ds:button.icon` is a subcomponent with
 * no `ds:tier`, and a required tier join is exactly what used to hide it: the
 * hand-written block list inner-joined the tier and surfaced it only under
 * `--all-tiers`, which is the defect the declared query's OPTIONAL join closed
