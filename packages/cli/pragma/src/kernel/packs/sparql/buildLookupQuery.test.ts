/**
 * The `?name` binding every generated lookup query shares.
 *
 * The unit under test is narrow but load-bearing: WHAT an entity's name is
 * decides which entities a `lookup` can address at all, and it must agree with
 * what the `list` story publishes. When it did not, `standard list` handed out
 * `react/component/tsdoc` and `standard lookup react/component/tsdoc` answered
 * ENTITY_NOT_FOUND — the two halves of the declared two-step grammar
 * disagreeing about the same entity.
 *
 * The agreement runs in BOTH directions, which is why the fallback is a
 * DECLARATION (`nameFallback: "iri"`) and not an inference from the presence of
 * a class constraint. A story whose list REQUIRES its `by` property publishes no
 * derived name, so deriving one for its lookup would make entities addressable
 * — and sampleable — under names the list never handed out. Both directions are
 * pinned below.
 *
 * The second half of this file is the ranking a name resolve ORDERS BY, pinned
 * as EMITTED TEXT with no store. That is deliberate: the store-backed suites
 * prove which block wins, and a store can only ever prove it for the entities it
 * holds — the emission is what says the rank is computed from a scope's declared
 * NAME rather than enumerated, that an asserted rank would take precedence over
 * the derived one, and that a story declaring no ranking is left exactly as it
 * was. None of those three survive as an assertion about one graph.
