/**
 * Generated, injection-safe SPARQL lookup queries for a pack story.
 *
 * Pack authors declare *what* names an entity (`by`, optional `type`/`types`)
 * and which properties to read; the query text is generated here so
 * user-supplied names are always escaped SPARQL string literals, and level-gated
 * fields below the active level are excluded from the projection (fetch-gating).
 * Matching on the name is exact and case-insensitive.
 *
 * WHAT an entity's name IS lives in one place — {@link nameBinding} — and every
 * form here uses it: the asserted `by` value, plus, for a lookup that DECLARES
 * `nameFallback: "iri"`, the IRI-derived name its class constraint can vouch
 * for. That single binding is what makes the population a `list` publishes and
 * the population a `lookup` answers to the same population.
 *
 * A name-addressed resolve RANKS, and returns every row it ranked. A name can
 * reach several entities (25 of the live design system's block names do), and
 * the `LIMIT 1` that used to sit under the ordering discarded all but the first
 * inside the STORE, where nothing downstream could see that it had happened —
 * `block lookup button` answered with Launchpad's Button and gave no sign the
 * global one existed, because `apps_launchpad…` sorts before `global…`.
 *
 * The limit is gone from the NAME forms so the resolver can see what it is
 * choosing between. It still answers with one entity — the arity is the tool's
 * contract — but the rows it did not take become the IRIs of its notice, which
 * is the only address that reaches them. (An IRI-addressed form keeps its
 * `LIMIT 1`: an IRI is one entity by construction, so there is nothing to rank
 * and nothing set aside.)
 *
 * The losers are NOT free, and an earlier draft of this comment claimed they
 * were. `lookupProjection`'s optionals sit in the same SELECT as the ranking, so
 * every matching URI has its declared fields projected, and a multi-valued field
 * multiplies rows per entity before `firstRowPerEntity` throws them away. On the
 * live graph that is small — 25 shared names, two entities each — but it is a
 * product, not a constant, and the honest shape is a two-phase resolve: rank the
 * URIs in a minimal SELECT, then project fields for the ones actually answered
 * with. That restructure is deliberately not done here: it is the same query the
 * pending no-limit change would rewrite again, and doing it twice would land two
 * migrations on one seam.
 *
 * The order is {@link rankingClause}'s `?score`, then `STR(?uri)`. The score
 * multiplies the two things a pack may declare about which entity a bare name
 * MEANS — `weights` (which KIND of thing) and `scopeWeight` (WHOSE) — and a
 * story that declares neither falls through to `STR(?uri)` alone, a total,
 * engine-independent order over a variable that is always bound (`?uri` carries
 * the class constraint, or the `by` triple when the name is not derived), so it
 * needs no unbound-value sentinel. That final key is what makes the ranking a
 * TOTAL order rather than a better arbitrary one.

 * the pairing, and this guard keeps a statically-compiled story from generating
 * a query with nothing bounding `?uri`): a derived name is only as trustworthy
 * as the class vouching for the entity it came from.
 *
 * One binding then serves the name resolve, the miss-suggestion pool, glob
