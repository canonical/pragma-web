/**
 * `runSelect` — the single choke point for every TRUSTED, generated SPARQL read.
 *
 * Pins the remap: a generated query is composed from declared and pack-authored
 * terms, never from user input, so a "Prefix not found" from the facade means
 * the store cannot answer this read — an actionable error, NOT a raw one
 * collapsing to INTERNAL_ERROR ("report this issue").
 *
 * WHICH actionable error is the story's provenance to decide, which is the
 * second thing pinned here. A DISTRIBUTION story keeps STORE_UNAVAILABLE and its
 * recovery, carrying BOTH the CLI command (`pragma sources update`) and the MCP
 * tool an agent calls (`sources_update`), so either surface can recover. A
 * CONFIG or PACKAGE story gets CONFIG_ERROR naming the story instead: its author
 * named a prefix nothing binds, and `sources update` cannot conjure a term.
