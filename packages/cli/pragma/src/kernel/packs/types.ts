/**
 * The pack grammar (v2) — "reads as data".
 *
 * A pack maps a noun to preferred queries: a SPARQL SELECT for the list story
 * and a generated, injection-safe lookup. One grammar and one compiler
 * ({@link ../compile}) project a pack into {@link ../../spec/types.VerbSpec}s;
 * the CLI and MCP projectors then treat pack verbs like any other. This closes
 * the two old forks — three read-noun styles collapse to one pack shape, and
 * the two pack compilers collapse to one.
 *
 * These types are hand-authored and zod-free so the compiler (reached on the
 * `--help`/`__complete` fast path via `capabilities/index`) never pulls zod;
 * {@link ../schema} validates the same shapes and is imported lazily, only for
 * dynamic (config/package) packs and in tests.
 *
 * Progressive disclosure is CANONICAL: a level tag names one of
 * `constants.DETAIL_LEVELS` (`summary` < `standard` < `detailed`), and gating
 * is by that canonical index — a pack's declared `levels` is any ordered subset
 * of the canonical set.
 */

 * would collide with a flag the CLI has already registered — a Commander
