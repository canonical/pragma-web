/**
 * The declaration rules a list story must satisfy to be COMPILABLE, checked
 * without zod so that every story is held to them — including the
 * distribution's own.
 *
 * WHY NOT IN THE GRAMMAR. `schema.ts` is the zod gate, and it runs for config-
 * and package-declared stories only: `capabilities/distribution.ts` compiles
 * `pragma.conf.ts` statically and never revalidates it, deliberately, because
 * zod on the `--help`/`__complete` fast path is latency every invocation pays.
 * The consequence was that three rules whose violation is a CONFIG_ERROR — a
 * query a page cannot wrap, a filtered variable the query does not project, a
 * filter with nothing to admit a value against — were declaration-time refusals
 * for a third-party author and FIRST-CALL failures for the distribution. The
 * same rule reaching one tier and missing the other is the shape this domain
 * keeps closing (see `compileStoryModule`), so the rules live here, in pure
 * string work the fast path can afford, and the grammar delegates to them
 * rather than restating them.
 *
 * These are the COMPILABILITY rules only. Everything about a definition's
 * SHAPE — required fields, enums, mutual exclusions, reserved param names —
 * stays in the zod schema, which is where a shape is best expressed and which
 * a statically typed `pragma.conf.ts` already satisfies by construction.

 *   declaration error an author reads once and a list that quietly answers
 *   from every tier while its heading claims a scope.
 * - Its own filters may not claim the `tier` param, which the kernel puts on
 *   every tiered noun's reads. A story filter of that name would collide with
 *   the flag Commander has already registered — the failure mode
 *   {@link RESERVED_STORY_PARAMS} exists to prevent, conditional here because
 *   an UNSCOPED noun's `tier` filter is legitimate (`variable list --tier`
 *   filters the token graph's own `dt:tier`, which this scope does not touch).
