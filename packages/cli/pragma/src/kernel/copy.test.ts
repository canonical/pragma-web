/**
 * The kernel is generic machinery: it may describe itself, but it may not name
 * the distribution in an authored string. A fork changes `pragma.conf.ts`;
 * anything the kernel hardcodes becomes a lie it cannot fix.
 *
 * What this guard enforces, exactly: no string literal under `src/kernel/**`
 * (plus `constants.ts` and `bin.ts`) contains the distribution's `name` as a
 * word, the domain phrase "design system", or any namespace IRI the
 * distribution declares in `prefixes`. Module specifiers are not copy and are
 * skipped; every remaining site that legitimately carries one is listed in
 * {@link EXEMPT} with its reason.
 *
 * `src/capabilities/**` and `pragma.conf.ts` are OUT of the rule above.
 * `pragma.conf.ts` is the file a fork edits, so it is content by definition;
 * `src/capabilities/**` carries the kernel's own nouns — their prompts,
 * setup copy, doctor findings and other runtime copy no doc publishes — and a
 * guard needing a 65-entry exemption list is a guard that mostly exempts. (The
 * `ds:` residue the exclusion was originally written for is gone: L-OPEN-9
 * left no hand-written data verb behind, and `distribution.test.ts` now proves
 * every data noun is exactly its declared story.) Two narrower rules reach it
 * instead, at the bottom of this
 * file — *a command a user is told to run is never a literal*, stated once as
 * a POSITION ({@link COMMAND_POSITIONS}, read over raw source so it holds
 * whatever the scanner can see) and once as a SHAPE (a backticked command
 * inside any authored literal, read through {@link readCopy} so an
 * interpolated one leaves no matching chunk). Neither rule carries an
 * exemption: the last one — the colophon narrative, this distribution's voice
 * in a capability source — became content the config declares
 * (`pragma.conf.ts#colophon`), which is what made removing it checkable.
 *
 * Beside the naming rules, the same scanner enforces the HOUSE VOICE rules for
 * user-facing copy ({@link COPY_RULES}, authored as data in `copy.ts`) over
 * both file sets — the kernel set above and `src/capabilities/**` — in the
 * last describe of this file. See `copy.ts` for what each rule bans and why.
 *
 * NOTE for a reader of an older revision: this docblock used to say the
 * `examples[].cmd` sweep and the `docs/reference/*.md` regen "have to move
 * together". They must be CONSISTENT, not simultaneous — the whole sweep was
 * measured to move zero doc bytes, because every literal it replaced was
 * already spelling this distribution's own name.

/**
 * The authored copy in a file: every string literal that is neither a module

 *
 * A single left-to-right pass, not a pair of regexes, because the two orderings
 * a regex pair allows are both wrong: strip comments first and any literal
 * containing `//` is truncated, re-pairing the quotes across the deleted tail
 * and hiding whatever followed; match literals first and an apostrophe in prose
 * ("the kernel's") opens a quote that never closes, which is also the shape
 * that makes the literal pattern backtrack catastrophically. Reading the file
 * in source order makes both cases fall out: a `//` inside a string belongs to
 * the string, an apostrophe inside a comment belongs to the comment.
 *
 * A REGEX LITERAL is code, not copy, and it is the third ordering hazard: a `"`
 * inside a regex (`/[<>"{}|\\^`\s]/`) would otherwise open a phantom string that
 * swallows every literal until the next `"` — so the scanner reads regexes as
 * regexes and skips them whole.
 *
 * A TEMPLATE SUBSTITUTION is the fourth, and the one this tree actually writes:
 * `${…}` is code, and the code inside it may open another template. Reading a
 * template as one flat span makes the NESTED backtick close the OUTER literal,
 * and every quote after it in the file pairs off by one — which left the whole
 * tail of `packs/renderPack.ts` invisible to this guard. So a substitution is
 * handed back to the code scanner, and the literal chunks around it are the copy.
 *
