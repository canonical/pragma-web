/**
 * Drive the GENERATED completion scripts in real bash, zsh and fish.
 *
 * Every other test in this directory stops at the boundary of the script's
 * text: `emitScripts.test.ts` snapshots it, `safety.test.ts` asserts what its
 * characters may not be, `parse.test.ts` pins what the resolver does with
 * words. Nothing executes it. A script that emits but does not parse leaves
 * `_pragma` undefined and TAB silently dead forever, and a script that frames
 * the delegation wrongly hands `__complete` the wrong slot while every unit
 * test stays green. Both are only observable by running the thing.
 *
 * So this file runs it — over BOTH grammars:
 *
 * - the FIXTURE grammar, for the M1 `--flag=value` wordbreak regression (with
 *   `=` in `COMP_WORDBREAKS`, bash splits `--format=` into `--format` `=` ``;
 *   without the normalization at the top of `_pragma` the value slot falls
 *   through to the noun/positional arm and offers the WRONG candidates);
 * - the LIVE grammar (`emitScripts(capabilities)`), which is the script users
 *   actually install and which no test had ever executed.
 *
 * Each driver puts a stand-in for the bin first on the child's `PATH`, which
 * both RECORDS the argv it was handed and ANSWERS with two candidates, so every
 * candidate set comes with the exec log that produced it and every exec can be
 * followed to what the user is offered. That turns `emitScripts.ts`'s docblock
 * claim — "the static tier answers STRUCTURE with zero exec; only
 * `{kind:"names"}` value contexts shell out" — into an assertion, pins the exact
 * argv the scripts hand `<bin> __complete`, and pins the last mile back.
 * Standing first on `PATH` also means a developer with a real `pragma`
 * installed can never have it exec'd by this suite.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVEN, AND WHERE — this split must not be blurred:
 *
 * - **By execution on every machine that runs the suite:** bash parses both
 *   scripts; the live bash script offers the live grammar's structure with
 *   zero process exec; it hands `__complete` a literal argv and offers back
 *   what it answers; it honours the `minChars` gate. The bash describes are
 *   deliberately NOT gated on a `hasShell` probe — CI runs linux with a modern
 *   bash, so a machine with no usable bash should fail this file loudly
 *   rather than skip it and report nothing. (The package no longer pins
 *   `os: ["linux"]`; run on a bash-3.2 macOS box this fails loudly, which is
 *   the intended signal — see `templates/bash.ts` on the mapfile floor.)
 * - **By execution only where the shell is installed:** the same guarantees
 *   for zsh and fish. Those describes `skipIf` the shell is absent, which
 *   includes this development box and, today, CI — so on those machines they
 *   assert NOTHING, and say so by skipping visibly. Every assertion in them
 *   was executed during development against zsh 5.9 and fish 3.7.0 (obtained
 *   with `apt-get download zsh zsh-common fish fish-common` + `dpkg-deb -x`
 *   into a scratch prefix, leaving the box itself untouched). Adding
 *   `zsh fish` to CI's apt step is what would make them continuous.
 * - **By static assertion only, everywhere:** that the zsh and fish scripts
 *   contain no `eval`, no backticks, guarded `compadd`, inert value lists and
 *   the exact delegation form — `safety.test.ts`'s script-safety describe. A
 *   static assertion is never an execution proof, and no name in this file
 *   claims one.
