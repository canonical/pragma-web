 * The three output modes every verb must render.

 * `plain` takes an optional {@link RenderContext} — the dispatcher's
 * presentation facts (`--no-headers`, whether stdout is a terminal). Only
 * list-shaped formatters read it; `llm` (the byte-frozen agent contract) and
 * `json` (the envelope) never see it.
 *
 * `notice` is the seam for what the DATA cannot say about itself. Return the
 * calm sentence when the payload would otherwise misrepresent the read; return
 * `undefined` (or omit the member) when it speaks for itself.
 *
 * Two shapes qualify, and they are the same failure. A zero-record result
 * ("empty ≠ silence"): an unbuilt store, a mistyped filter and a genuinely empty
 * result were all `{"ok":true,"data":[],"meta":{}}`. And a result that is one of
 * several it could have been — a `lookup` whose name reached more entities than
 * the one it answers with. A caller shown Launchpad's `Button` has no way to
 * discover the global one from a payload that looks exactly like an unambiguous
 * hit; the notice names the IRIs the answer did not take, which is the only
 * address that reaches them.
 *
 * It was called `emptyNotice` while emptiness was the only case. The channel is
 * unchanged — same key, same three surfaces — so this is one seam covering both,
 * not a second one grown beside it.
 *
 * Three surfaces route it, each in its own register — it is one seam, not a
 * plain-mode courtesy:
 * - `plain`: the dispatcher writes it to STDERR with exit 0, keeping the stdout
 *   data stream free of human sentences a pipe would read as records. `--quiet`
 *   mutes it (success-path guidance).
 * - `--format json` AND the MCP tool result: it rides the envelope as
 *   `meta.notice` (`project/cli/dispatch.ts#renderData`,
 *   `project/mcp/registerVerb.ts#emptyMeta` — the same key from the same seam,
 *   so the two MACHINE surfaces stay byte-equal). `data` keeps its uniform empty
 *   shape; `[]` stays `[]`. Without it an agent could not tell an unbuilt store,
 *   a mistyped filter and a genuinely empty result apart — all three were
 *   `{"ok":true,"data":[],"meta":{}}`.
 * - `llm` (the byte-frozen agent contract) is the ONE mode that still ignores
 *   it: it renders one stream and its bytes are frozen.
 *
 * The formatters themselves never see the notice: `json(d)` renders the data
 * alone, and the ENVELOPE layer carries the notice beside it.
