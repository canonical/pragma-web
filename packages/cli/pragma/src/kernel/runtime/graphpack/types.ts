/**
 * Graphpack artifact contracts — the five files a built pack directory holds,
 * as hand-written types with NO runtime dependency.
 *
 * A pack is the content-addressed, boot-ready form of a set of RDF sources:
 * `data.nq` (the store's n-quads dump — boots via ke's cache path, no TTL
 * parse), `schema.json` (the serialized ke-graphql extraction — boots via
 * `compileFromExtraction`, no live 7-pass compile), `index.json` (the storeless
 * entity index the completion tier and reads consume), `stories.json` (the read
 * stories the packages ship, carried verbatim as raw text), and `manifest.json`
 * (provenance + the prefixes the store was built with). A directory missing
 * `manifest.json` is treated as absent (a torn build), so writes are always
 * temp-dir + atomic rename.
 *
 * FIVE AND ONLY FIVE: the constants below are the single place the artifact set
 * is named, and three modules must agree with them — `buildPack` writes them,
 * `packIsComplete` gates on them, and `materializeEmbeddedPack` writes them back
 * out. A sixth artifact added to only some of those makes a pack whose content
 * hash claims more than its directory holds, which the next build then reuses,
 * silently dropping the difference. The agreement is pinned by `graphpack.test.ts`'s
 * "the committed embedded pack (PROTECTED) > materializes exactly the files
 * buildPack produces" — extend the set here and that test fails until every
 * side follows.
 *
 * This module is on the STORELESS FAST PATH — `capabilities/index.ts` →
 * `resolveSources` → `packIsComplete` → `readManifest` reaches it while
 * `__complete` builds the command tree — so it carries NO runtime import at
 * all. It used to hold the zod schemas too, which put zod on that graph through
 * a genuine value import and cost ~3–4 ms of a ~30 ms budget; they now live in
 * `schemas.ts`, imported only by the two readers that are already off the fast
 * path. `capabilities/lazy.test.ts` pins the result — no module on that graph
 * imports zod — so the split cannot silently close.
