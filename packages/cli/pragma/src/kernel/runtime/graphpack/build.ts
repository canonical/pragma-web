/**
 * Build a content-addressed pack from RDF source inputs.
 *
 * This is the ONE place the live ke-graphql 7-pass `compile` runs (~210 ms):
 * building is when we can afford it. The store is created once (parsing the
 * TTL and writing the `data.nq` n-quads dump via ke's cache), the schema is
 * extracted and serialized, the entity index is built, and a manifest is
 * written LAST so the directory is only ever observed complete. Writes go to a
 * temp directory and are atomically renamed into `packs/<contentHash>/`, so a
 * crashed build never leaves a half-written pack; a hash whose directory is
 * already complete is reused untouched.
 *
 * Reached only behind a dynamic import (`sources update`), never on the
 * storeless fast path.

/**
 * Refresh a REUSED pack's recorded builder version to the CLI doing the reuse.

 * Without this, `sources update` could not get a project out of the state the
 * boot decision's upgrade row describes. A pack is content-addressed, so an
 * update whose sources have not moved resolves to the same hash and reuses the
 * directory untouched — manifest and all. The manifest would therefore keep
 * naming the OLD CLI as its builder, the boot would go on passing the pack over,
 * and the `pragma sources update` the notice recommends would change nothing:
 * a loop with no way out but `sources reset`.
 *
 * Only the version moves. `createdAt` and `sourceRef` describe the build that
 * produced these bytes and stay as they were — a reuse is not a new build, and
 * `sources status` reporting today's date for a pack from last month would be
 * the same kind of lie in the other direction. What the stamp claims is exactly
 * what happened: THIS CLI resolved these sources and found this pack already
 * holding what it would have built.
 *
 * Best-effort, and deliberately so: the write is a provenance refresh, not part
 * of the build, so a read-only or racing cache returns the manifest as found
 * rather than failing an update that otherwise succeeded (the user keeps the
 * notice, which is recoverable, instead of losing the update, which is worse).
 *
 * @param dir - The reused pack directory.
 * @param cached - Its manifest, as read.
 * @param version - The running CLI's version.
 * @returns The manifest as it now stands on disk.
 * @note Impure — rewrites `manifest.json` in place (temp file + atomic rename,
 *   so the completeness marker is never observed half-written).
