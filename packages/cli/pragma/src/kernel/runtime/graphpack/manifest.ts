 * directory and the manifest is renamed in last), so an absent or invalid
 * manifest means "treat the pack as not there".
 *
 * This module is on the storeless FAST PATH (`resolveSources` → `packIsComplete`
 * → here, while `__complete` builds the command tree), so it validates the ~1 KB
 * manifest structurally instead of importing zod to do it — that import was
 * ~3–4 ms of a ~30 ms budget. {@link validateManifest} is held to the schema's
 * behaviour by `graphpack.test.ts`, which pins the two to accept the same inputs
 * in both directions; `schemas.ts` remains the executable specification.

 * Whether `stories.json` holds what its reader expects: a JSON ARRAY.

 * `buildPack` REUSED the directory and every package-declared noun vanished
 * while `sources update` reported success — with `parseRecords`' fix, without

 * pack: the boot decision reports the ordinary STORE_UNAVAILABLE and the next

 * get.

 * A malformed or schema-invalid RECORD is the one guard in
 * `packs/collect.validateStories`, which names it on stderr and under `doctor`
 * — a story a third party got wrong must not make the whole pack unreadable.
 *
 * `data.nq` and `schema.json` stay SIZE-gated on purpose. A truncated `data.nq`
 * is caught downstream by `readPack`'s A9 triple-count cross-check, which is
 * stronger than any parse here; a corrupt `schema.json` still surfaces
 * unclassified, and that gap is pinned separately rather than absorbed into this
 * one — this is the fast path, and it parses only the artifact whose failure is
 * otherwise invisible.
