/**
 * Boot a {@link StoreSession} from a built pack directory — the perf keystone.
 *
 * The store loads from `data.nq` through ke's cache path (no TTL parse), and
 * the executable GraphQL schema is rebuilt from `schema.json` via ke-graphql's
 * `compileFromExtraction` — passes 2-7, pure JS, no store, no SPARQL. The live
 * 7-pass `compile` is NEVER called here; that only runs at build time. The
 * entity index is a plain `JSON.parse`. The result is an immutable session the
 * lazy store memoizes for the process's lifetime.
 *
 * Reached only behind a dynamic import (store boot), never on the storeless
 * fast path.

  // a SHORTFALL means the dump was truncated (fewer triples than were built) —
  // it passes the mere size>0 completeness gate yet would serve a partial graph
  // silently, so it must surface STORE_UNAVAILABLE here. A benign SUPERSET (more
  // triples than recorded — e.g. a future ke counting change) is TOLERATED
  // rather than treated as corruption, so such a change can't trip a fleet-wide
  // false STORE_UNAVAILABLE. Older packs without the count fall back to the
  // "populated index but empty store" check (via the now-empty dump,
  // `packIsComplete` turns false so recovery rebuilds) rather than serving an
  // empty graph as the pack.
  // `store.size` is a field oxigraph maintains. The equivalent query —
  // `SELECT (COUNT(*)) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, which is what `build.ts` still runs
  // to WRITE `tripleCount` — is a scan, and it ran on every boot to read a
  // number the store already knew.
  //
  // The two agree: ke queries with `use_default_graph_as_union`, and oxigraph
  // does not deduplicate across that union, so a quad count and the union's
  // solution count are the same number even for a triple repeated across
  // graphs. Verified against 0.5.6 rather than assumed — and the guard is `<`,
  // which tolerates the direction a set-semantic union would drift.
