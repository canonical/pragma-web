/**
 * Store-backed single-entity read: the GRAPH NEIGHBOURHOOD of one URI.
 *
 * The ONE reader shared by the `graph inspect` CLI verb and the MCP resource
 * `read` — so a resource read and a `graph inspect` of the same URI return
 * identical content (the mirror contract). The URI is resolved through the
 * store's merged prefix map and validated safe for `<iri>` embedding — via
 * `resolveUri` → `assertSafeIri`, which rejects every IRI-breaking character
 * (`<>"{}|\^\`` + whitespace) — before it is interpolated, so a prefixed name or
 * absolute IRI addresses the subject exactly and user input never reaches the
 * query text raw.
 *
 * Four things make the payload answerable rather than merely faithful:
 *
 * - **Typed terms.** Read from ke's `termBindings` (the term-preserving view of
 *   the SAME rows), never the stringly `bindings`. This is what makes prefix
 *   compaction SAFE: only a `NamedNode` is compacted, so a literal whose text
 *   happens to start with a namespace IRI is no longer silently rewritten into
 *   something that reads as an IRI. It also keeps `datatype`/`language`, which
 *   the string view drops.
 * - **Inbound relations.** Everything pointing AT the subject, grouped by
 *   predicate. Without it the entity that a resource is supposed to describe
 *   cannot answer "what implements this?" or "what inherits from this?" — the
 *   relations live on the OTHER side of the arrow and were simply invisible.
 * - **Nested blank nodes.** A blank node is a store-local handle: it re-mints on
 *   every load and is unreachable through `pragma:{+uri}`. Inlining one level
 *   turns a dead `_:hash` into the record it stands for (a changelog entry's
 *   text/type/timestamp). Depth ONE is not a shortcut — 11 of this graph's 922
 *   blank nodes nest, so one level is what there is to inline.
 * - **Neighbour titles.** Every named neighbour carries the human name the index
 *   already holds, so a reader is not forced into a second read per IRI just to
 *   learn that `ds:tag.needsdocumentation` is "needs:documentation".
 *
 * Bounded by the SHARED disclosure ladder, and by what an inbound group IS —
 * because not every edge pointing at an entity is the same kind of thing:
 *
 * - A RELATION fans in narrowly and every subject is part of the answer
 *   (`ds:implementsBlock`, `ds:inheritsFrom`), so it is LISTED.
 * - A ROSTER fans in without bound because it grows with the data rather than
 *   the model — a class extension (`rdf:type`), a tier's membership (`ds:tier`,
 *   141 deep here) — and is already answered by `pragma/instanceCount` and by
 *   the noun's list verb. So it is SAMPLED: a few exemplars, flagged `sampled`,
 *   never a page. Listing rosters cost a `detailed` read 19.5 KB on one class
 *   and 20.9 KB on one tier, restating what a single `*_list` answers properly.
 *
 * The two are told apart by FAN-IN, not by predicate name, so the kernel names
 * no vocabulary and a graph whose rosters hang off different predicates is
 * bounded just the same. `count` always reports the TRUE total either way: a
 * sample that silently passed for the whole set is how "3 implementations"
 * becomes a wrong answer.
 *
 * Reached only behind the lazy store (a `needsStore` verb / a resource read), so
 * it never lands on the storeless fast path.
