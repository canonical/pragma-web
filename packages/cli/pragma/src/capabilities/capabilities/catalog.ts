/**
 * The SELF-UPDATING capabilities catalog.
 *
 * `buildCapabilitiesData(modules)` projects the LIVE grammar: it emits the
 * surface, walks `mcpSurface.tools` (the sorted, covenant-conformant set), and
 * annotates each tool from the guidance its OWN verb declares (`useWhen`,
 * `example` — see `kernel/spec/guidance.ts`). The tool set, the
 * category counts, and the discovery-sample list are all DERIVED — never pinned
 * — so the catalog tracks the surface automatically (the fix for the old shell's
 * hand-maintained list, which drifted to name retired tools).
 *
 * Pure + zod-free: it reads only `emitSurface` (itself fast-path-safe), so the
 * verb's storeless guarantee holds. The conventions + discovery strings live
 * here, on the distribution's side — they name its tools and tiers — and reach
 * the kernel's handshake instructions as data ({@link ORIENTATION}), so the two
 * can never diverge and the kernel names no tool.
