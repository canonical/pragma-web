/**
 * The SELF-UPDATING capabilities catalog.
 *
 * `buildCapabilitiesData(modules)` projects the LIVE grammar: it emits the
 * surface, walks `mcpSurface.tools` (the sorted, covenant-conformant set), and
 * annotates each tool from the authored `TOOL_HINTS` table. The tool set, the
 * category counts, and the discovery-sample list are all DERIVED — never pinned
 * — so the catalog tracks the surface automatically (the fix for the old shell's
 * hand-maintained list, which drifted to name retired tools).
 *
 * Pure + zod-free: it reads only `emitSurface` (itself fast-path-safe), so the
 * verb's storeless guarantee holds. The conventions + discovery strings are
 * exported so `kernel/project/mcp/instructions.ts` derives the handshake
 * orientation from the SAME source and the two can never diverge.

/**
 * The four orientation conventions, and the single source both the

 * a domain — the live tool catalog the same handshake carries already says
 * which nouns exist. `querying` is verbatim from the old shell (the SPARQL
 * model is still accurate for v2); `mutations` is new in v2, surfacing the
 * plan-first/confirm gate.
 *
 * `model` is the one that has had to be rewritten twice, and both times because
 * it was describing a gate that had moved. It stopped claiming reads were
 * tier/channel-scoped when the hand-written filtering was removed (the
 * hierarchy became graph data, not a query gate) — and "Reads are unscoped —
 * every list shows everything" became false the day the tier scope landed. An
 * agent reading it took a scoped `block_list` for the whole design system,
 * which is the exact misreading the sentence existed to prevent. So it now says
 * what is true of each half separately: the TIER hierarchy gates a read of a
 * tiered noun and names the argument that widens it, while the CHANNEL is still
 * data on the entity and gates nothing.
