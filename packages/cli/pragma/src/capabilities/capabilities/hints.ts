/**
 * The one authored input to the `capabilities` catalog: a `use_when` behavioural
 * hint + category per tool. Everything else (the tool SET, counts, discovery
 * samples) is DERIVED from the live grammar at build time, so this table is the
 * only thing to keep in sync — and the drift-guard test (`capabilities.test.ts`)
 * fails CI if a live tool has no hint, a hint names a tool that no longer
 * exists, or a hint's category disagrees with the tool's real `mutates` flag.
 *
 * `use_when` strings for the surviving tools are ported verbatim from the old
 * shell's `domains/llm/data/toolCatalog.ts`; the net-new v2 tools (config_set,
 * graph_query, setup, upgrade, doctor, capabilities, prompt_*, sources_*,
 * tier_lookup, create_*) are authored here.
