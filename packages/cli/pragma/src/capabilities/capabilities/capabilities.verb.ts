/**
 * The `capabilities` orientation verb (noun `capabilities`, self-verb).
 *
 * Storeless read: it returns the grammar-derived tool catalog + conventions +
 * discovery sequence an agent reads at session start. It replaces the retired
 * old-shell `llm` tool — the live-context half of that tool (tier/channel/entity
 * counts) is deliberately DROPPED here (it would require a store boot at
 * orientation) and lives in `info` / `config show` / `sources status` instead.
 *
 * `run` is a lazy thunk that dynamic-imports the catalog, the capability
 * registry barrel and the dispatch-time merge, so building the command tree
 * never pulls the derivation onto the `--help`/`__complete` fast path, and the
 * tool never boots the store (`store.booted` stays false — the storeless-spy
 * invariant).
 *
 * It reports the EFFECTIVE modules, not the static registry: the MCP server
 * registers its tools from the same merge, so a catalog built from the static
 * set would omit exactly the config- and package-declared nouns `tools/list`
 * advertises — the hand-maintained drift this catalog exists to end. With no
 * declared stories the merge returns the registry by identity, so the payload is
 * unchanged.
