/**
 * Formatters for `pragma colophon` — plain (styled Markdown), llm (condensed
 * Markdown passthrough), json (the structured envelope). Pure and dependency-
 * light: the plain path routes through the `chalk`-only {@link
 * renderMarkdownToTerminal}; there is NO Ink here.
 *
 * The section title is composed as an H1 (`# <title>`) and fed through the ONE
 * styler, so all heading styling lives in a single place and the authored body
 * (which carries no leading H1) is never double-titled.
 *
 * The formatters render whatever sections the collector hands them and decide
 * nothing about which sections exist — that choice (the domain's story, or the
 * toolchain's when no domain tells one) belongs to the collector, and keeping
 * it there is what lets these stay pure.
