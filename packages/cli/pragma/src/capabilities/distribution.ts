/**
 * The distribution's own read stories, compiled at module load.
 *
 * `pragma.conf.ts` declares them on the packs that supply them; this is the ONE
 * place those declarations become capabilities. They come through the SAME door
 * a third-party story does — {@link compileStoryModule} — so the mechanism the CLI
 * offers forks is the mechanism the CLI itself runs on.
 *
 * They are compiled STATICALLY rather than merged at dispatch on purpose: the
 * `--help` / `__complete` fast paths read the static capability set, and
 * `surface/surface.v2.json` freezes the emitted surface, so a noun that only
 * arrived at dispatch would vanish from help and completion on a fresh install.
 * That is affordable because this module is zod-free and pure — `pragma.conf.ts`
 * is inert data and the compiler builds specs without touching the store.
 *
 * Config- and package-declared stories still OVERRIDE these at dispatch; the
 * `story` marker on each module is what tells `assembleEffectiveModules` which
 * modules may be replaced.
