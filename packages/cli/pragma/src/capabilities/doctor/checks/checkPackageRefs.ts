/**
 * Doctor check: report which pack answers this project's reads.
 *
 * It switches on the ONE boot decision ({@link resolveSources}) rather than
 * re-deriving it from config, so doctor can never call an install healthy that
 * every read would fail. That is the whole point of the check: a project that
 * configured its own packs and never built them reports `fail` with the update
 * remedy — not a pass listing the distribution's packs it is not reading.
 * Storeless throughout: the pointer, the manifest, and the entity index are
 * read off disk, never through a store session.
 *
 * It also names every read story that pack carries but cannot use. Those are
 * DROPPED at dispatch rather than thrown (a third-party story must never break
 * a command), so doctor is where the user finds out — and it goes through the
 * same `validateStories` the dispatch path uses, so the two can never disagree.
