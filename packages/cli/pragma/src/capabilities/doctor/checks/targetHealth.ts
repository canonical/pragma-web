/**
 * The scoped doctor rows, derived from the setup target table.
 *
 * `doctor` and `setup` are the SAME LIST. Every scoped row here carries a
 * target id verbatim — `completions`, not "Shell completions"; `mcp`, not "MCP
 * configured" — because the row name IS the fix command's argument, and a user
 * who reads `✗ mcp` beside `fix: pragma setup mcp` can see that they are the
 * same thing. Two checks reporting on one target under two different names, one
 * of which no command accepts, is how a report ends up describing a machine
 * nobody can repair.
 *
 * Every row's detection comes from the target table's own `detect`, so the two
 * surfaces cannot disagree about what they looked at, and every `fix:` is
 * derived from the row's id and scope rather than authored per check.
 *
 * Doctor's UNSCOPED environment checks (Node version, the CLI's own version,
 * pack refs, the store) diagnose things setup cannot install and stay outside
 * this list.
 *
 * ONE scoped row is not a target: `harnesses`, the per-scope inventory. It is an
 * inventory of the machine the targets are measured against, not a target that
 * can be set up, so it deliberately carries no `fix:` and can never be `fail`
 * or `available` — see {@link inventoryChecks}. The bijection between the other
 * rows and the setup table is untouched: `harnesses` is not a `TargetId`, and
 * nothing derives a command from it.

 * registry is what says which key a given harness writes. Without that join the
 * only state available per harness is the file's aggregate — and a
