/**
 * The harness inventory: one row per harness per scope, saying what was detected
 * and whether pragma is registered in it.
 *
 * Every fact this needs was ALREADY COMPUTED and thrown away.
 * `TargetGroup.harnessNames` carries every harness sharing a config file and
 * both consumers reduced it to `shortenPath(group.path)`; `McpDetection`
 * carries the `absent`/`registered`/`drifted` classification of every WRITE in
 * that file. The only thing detection could NOT answer is the negative —
 * `detectHarnesses` filters to hits, so a harness the machine does not have was
 * unrepresentable — which is why the roll-up takes the REGISTRY alongside the
 * groups: the registry supplies the universe, the groups supply the state.
 *
 * The state arrives PER HARNESS, never per file. A shared `.vscode/mcp.json`
 * holds VS Code's `servers` and Cline's `mcpServers` as two independent
 * entries, so the file's aggregate — `drifted`, when one key is current and the
 * other absent — is the standing of NEITHER harness. Pairing each name with
 * the write it owns is the caller's job (it holds the registry's `mcpKey`s and
 * the group's writes); by the time a group reaches this module the association
 * is resolved and every name carries its own state.
 *
 * Three deliberate constraints:
 *
 * 1. **No `@canonical/harnesses` import, of any kind.** `capabilities/lazy.test`
 *    forbids one from any file statically reachable from `capabilities/index`,
 *    and its regex has no `import type` exemption. This module is reached only
 *    through `runChecks`'s dynamic import today, but it is written so that
 *    staying legal never depends on that: the inputs are declared here as
 *    narrow structural records.
 *
 * 2. **Narrowed to DATA, so `mutates: false` is enforced rather than asserted.**
 *    `McpDetection` is write-capable — it carries `writeMcpConfigTargets` and
 *    `removeMcpConfigFrom` as live function references. Projecting it down to
 *    {@link InventoryGroup} before it reaches this file means a read-only
 *    report literally cannot reach a writer.
 *
 * 3. **It never invents a failure.** The states an inventory can report map onto
 *    `pass`/`available`/`skip` and NEVER `fail` (see `../types.ts`): a machine
 *    that simply does not have Windsurf is not a broken machine, and the `mcp`
 *    row already owns the actionable finding for the harnesses it does have.
 *    Reporting it twice is how a failure count becomes noise.
 *
 * Placement: this is a doctor helper because doctor is its only consumer today,
 * and `shared/` is explicitly not a utility drawer (see `shared/index.ts`). It
 * is written to MOVE there unchanged — pure, no capability imports beyond the
 * scope type — the moment `setup`'s detection summary becomes the second caller.

/**
 * What the inventory says about one harness in one scope.
 *
 * The vocabulary is deliberately NOT "installed". Two different claims used
 * to share that word — `DetectedHarness.configExists` ("the harness's own
 * config file exists", a harnesses-package field this module never surfaces)
 * and the pragma-entry state (`McpTargetState`, which now says `registered`
 * for exactly this reason). Every state here names the PRAGMA-ENTRY meaning.
 * One name per claim, held across the reports: "installed" is reserved for
 * artifacts the CLI itself places (the completion script, the LSP extension),
 * "registered" for pragma's entry in someone else's config, "linked" for
 * skill symlinks.
 *
 * - `registered` — detected, and pragma's MCP entry in this scope is current.
 * - `drifted` — detected, and a pragma entry exists but differs from what a
 *   write would emit. Actionable, but the `mcp` row is where it is actionED;
 *   here it is reported without inflating the failure count.
 * - `detected` — the harness is on this machine; pragma is not registered.
 * - `undetected` — in the registry, has a location in this scope, not found.
 * - `unscoped` — in the registry, but has NO config location in this scope at
 *   all. Roo Code and Cline are `scope: "project"`, so neither can ever hold a
 *   global entry: Cline is a VS Code EXTENSION whose config is the workspace
 *   `.vscode/mcp.json`, and Roo Code's is `.roo/mcp.json` — neither keeps a
 *   per-user file of its own. (VS Code itself used to be the example here, and
 *   stopped being one when its per-user `mcp.json` was added: it is
 *   `scope: "both"` now.) Stated rather than omitted: a verbose listing that
 *   silently dropped a row reads as a bug in the listing.
