/**
 * The list→lookup grammar, EXECUTED against the shipped pack, for every noun
 * that has both halves (PROTECTED).
 *
 * The tool descriptions instruct an agent to take a row's `name` VERBATIM from
 * `<noun>_list` to `<noun>_lookup`. That promise broke for `standard` when the
 * shipped data and the story keyed the two halves on different properties:
 * `standard list` published names synthesized from the IRI while
 * `standard lookup` answered only the ~13% of standards carrying an asserted
 * `cs:name` — a closed loop where every published address missed (#1047). The
 * fixture suites could not see it, because a fixture obligingly asserts
 * whatever the story reads; only the corpus the release actually ships can
 * falsify the promise the release actually makes.
 *
 * So this file boots the SHIPPED graph and asserts the round trip over the
 * WHOLE corpus, not a sample, for every noun with a list+lookup pair — the
 * defect class is not standard-specific, since every pair shares this
 * machinery. Three guarantees per noun:
 *
 * - every name `list` publishes resolves through `lookup` (executed through
 *   the real verb bodies, so glob/IRI argument-shape dispatch is exercised
 *   with the very strings an agent would paste);
 * - every published name is in the addressable population (`listEntityNames`
 *   — the ONE pool that feeds miss-suggestions, glob expansion AND `sample`'s
 *   draw), so a suggestion can never offer a name the resolve cannot answer;
 * - for a story that derives names (`nameFallback: "iri"`), that pool covers
 *   the WHOLE class population — `sample` is presented as "see real data
 *   shapes", and drawing only from the subset carrying an asserted name would
 *   be the #1047 defect wearing sample's clothes.
 *
 * The final describe is the negative control: the same assertions run against
 * a fixture compiled in the exact pre-#1047 shape (a list that synthesizes
 * names over a lookup that requires the asserted property) and are shown to
 * FAIL. A guard whose failing case no longer fails is worse than no guard.
