/**
 * THE target table — the one list `setup` and `doctor` both read.
 *
 * Five rows, each with a scope column. This table drives the `setup <target>`
 * sub-verbs, the wizard's choices, the `--dry-run` plan, the progress lines, the
 * recap, the doctor rows, and each doctor row's `fix:` line. Adding a sixth
 * target is one row here — not a new sub-verb, a new check, a new recap branch
 * and a new fix string that four separate files have to agree about.
 *
 * A row owns: its identity (`id` is BOTH the sub-verb argument and the doctor
 * row name, so `mcp` and `setup mcp` visibly share a token), which scopes it can
 * be installed into, how to DETECT its current state, how to PLAN a run from
 * that detection, and how to COMPOSE the forward and removal effects. Detection
 * runs once per invocation and feeds every reader, so setup and doctor cannot
 * disagree about what they looked at.
 *
 * What a row does NOT own is diagnosis. `doctor/runChecks.ts` maps a row's
 * detection onto a check result itself: the completions check needs helpers that
 * live under `doctor/`, and importing them here would make the two directories
 * import each other. The bijection is unaffected — doctor enumerates THIS table
 * and derives every row name and `fix:` line from it.
 *
 * This module is reached only through the verb's lazy dynamic import (and
 * doctor's), so nothing here lands on the `--help`/`__complete` fast path.
