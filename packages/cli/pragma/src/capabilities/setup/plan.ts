 * The setup plan — ONE structure with four readers.

 * `--dry-run` prints it, the wizard edits its `selected` flags, progress reports
 * one line per row as its outcome lands, and the recap is the same rows with
 * `outcome` filled. `--format json` emits `{ scope, roots, rows }` verbatim.
 * Doctor reads the same target table (see {@link ./targets.js}) so the two
 * surfaces cannot disagree about what they looked at.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately flat and JSON-ready: no class, no live handle, no
 * task. A row is a fact about what a run WOULD do (or, once `outcome` is set,
 * what it did), which is why the plan can be rendered before, during, and after
 * the run without any reader having to know which phase produced it.
 *
 * This module is pure data + pure derivations. It carries no import of the
 * operations, the harnesses runtime, or React — so the renderers, the doctor
 * checks, and the verb can all reach it without dragging anything heavy along.
