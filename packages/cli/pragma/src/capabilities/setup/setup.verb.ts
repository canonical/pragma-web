/**
 * The `setup` verbs — the run-all self-verb plus the five CLI-only sub-verbs
 * (`config`/`completions`/`lsp`/`mcp`/`skills`), every one of them derived from
 * the target table.
 *
 * `setup` is the ONE covenant noun that is BOTH directly runnable and has
 * sub-verbs. All of them are storeless, interactive mutations. The sub-verbs are
 * `mcp: false` (`buildServer` skips them, `buildProgram` still registers them);
 * only the self-verb is an MCP tool. `destructive: false` keeps MCP from
 * advertising the tool as destructive.
 *
 * THE SCOPE DEFAULT IS GLOBAL. `--scope` used to default to `both`, and `both`
 * runs each harness's own default scope — which is `project` for most of the
 * registry — so a bare `setup` scattered `.mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`
 * and `opencode.json` into whatever directory you happened to be standing in.
 * The user scope is what a machine-level installer configures; the project scope
 * is a deliberate, checked-in, team-shared choice, and is now chosen with
 * `--local` rather than assumed.
 *
 * Every sub-verb registers the scope flags UNIFORMLY. That is what lets the scope
 * answer come from the table instead of per-verb flag wiring — previously
 * `setup completions --local` died as an unknown option, while `setup mcp
 * --local` worked, for no reason a user could see. Asking a target for a scope it
 * cannot honour is a usage error (exit 2) with the corrected command; asking the
 * RUN-ALL for such a band merely filters, and the out-of-band target still shows
 * as a named row.
 *
 * summon-core + the generator ops stay behind a LAZY dynamic import (mirroring
 * `create`'s `loadCreateRuntime`), so building the command tree / `--help` /
 * `__complete` — and `setup --yes` — load no React/Ink.
