/**
 * "Could this command write there?" — asked BEFORE anything is written.
 *
 * Two machines answer no, and until this probe existed both answered it the
 * same wrong way. A NixOS or home-manager user's `~/.vscode/extensions` is a
 * symlink into `/nix/store`, which is a read-only filesystem by design:
 * `--install-extension` failed with a raw fs error, or appeared to succeed and
 * changed nothing. A managed config directory turned the MCP write into a
 * `failed` row carrying an EACCES message and no next step. Neither is a
 * failure of this command — the machine is configured exactly as its owner
 * intends — so both become NAMED SKIPS whose remedy is the one action that
 * works there: declaring the extension, or the MCP entry, in the config that
 * owns the directory.
 *
 * Per the owner, 2026-09-16: the decision is made by the DIRECTORY, never by
 * the OS. Nix is not a platform to branch on — a Nix user's home directory is
 * ordinary, a non-Nix user can have a read-only mount, and `/etc/nixos` says
 * nothing about whether THIS path is writable. So the probe walks the path it
 * was actually given.
 *
 * The whole filesystem surface is the injected {@link FsProbe}, so every
 * branch is exercised over a seam rather than by arranging a real read-only
 * directory (which a test running as root cannot do at all). It lives under
 * `setup/operations/` because setup is its one consumer: doctor reads the
 * result off the detection records setup already produced, and never probes
 * a second time.

 * Three rules, in this order:
 *
 * 1. **Walk up to the nearest node that exists**, starting AT the target. The
 *    target itself when it is there — home-manager symlinks `mcp.json`
 *    directly into the store while leaving `User/` writable, so stopping at
 *    the parent directory would call that file writable and then fail on the
 *    write. Otherwise its nearest existing ancestor, because a path that does
 *    not exist yet is writable exactly when the directory that would hold it
 *    is.
 * 2. **`realpathSync` it**, so the answer is about the real filesystem rather
 *    than the symlink standing in front of it.
 * 3. **`/nix/store/` wins over `W_OK`.** Checked first, deliberately: the
 *    store is read-only, so `access(W_OK)` would fail there too and the row
 *    would report "read-only" with a remedy about file permissions — advice
 *    that cannot work, because `chmod` on the store is not the fix and would
 *    be undone by the next `nixos-rebuild`. The remedy for a store path is a
 *    declaration in the user's own config, and naming the store is what earns
 *    it.
 *
 * @param target - The file or directory a write would create or modify.
 * @param fs - The filesystem seam; defaults to the real `node:fs`.
 * @returns The block, or `undefined` when the path is writable.
 * @note Impure by default — it stats and resolves real paths. Every branch is
 * reachable through the injected {@link FsProbe}.
