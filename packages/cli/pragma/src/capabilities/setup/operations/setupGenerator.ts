/**
 * Synthesize a setup invocation as a summon `GeneratorDefinition` driven by the
 * TARGET TABLE, so the run-all and every sub-verb flow through the same
 * `execute` seam `create` uses — inheriting the Ink wizard, the recap/confirm
 * gate, live progress, colours, and the shared cancel fixes by construction.
 *
 * The shape mirrors `create`: detection runs FOR REAL up front (once per
 * target/scope, in `detectTargets`), then a PURE `generate` composes only the
 * effects for the SELECTED rows. `generate` must stay re-interpretable —
 * `execute` invokes it more than once (the confirm-gate preview and the build) —
 * so it is composed from combinators and does no reads of its own.
 *
 * The wizard is the PLAN'S EDITOR, not a parallel path: its choices are the plan
 * rows, and what it edits is each row's `selected` flag. There is exactly one
 * list of things this command can do, and the preview, the wizard, the progress
 * lines and the recap are four views of it.
 *
 * This module carries NO static import of `@canonical/summon-core` VALUES or of
 * React/Ink — it only `import type`s the generator shape and builds plain object
 * literals over `@canonical/task`. It is itself reached only through the verb's
 * lazy dynamic import, so the fast paths stay free of it.
