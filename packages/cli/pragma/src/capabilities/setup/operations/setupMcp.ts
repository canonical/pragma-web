/**
 * `setup mcp` — register the pragma MCP server in detected AI harnesses.
 *
 * Split into `detectMcp` (harness detection runs FOR REAL up front, via
 * `runTask` over safe reads, and the resolved config targets are deduplicated
 * into per-file {@link TargetGroup}s for the chosen `--scope`) and `composeMcp`
 * (a pure, re-runnable write body driven by the SELECTED groups). Each write is
 * a distinct `(path, mcpKey)` so two harnesses sharing a file (VS Code + Cline)
 * each preserve the other. What a run SAYS about each file is the plan row's
 * per-file children, not a log line composed here.
 *
 * Detection ALSO reads each group's existing config (via `readMcpConfigFrom`,
 * FOR REAL up front) and classifies every group as `absent` (no pragma entry
 * yet), `registered` (the pragma entry already matches what we'd write), or
 * `drifted` (a pragma entry exists but differs). The wizard shows that prior
 * state in each row and DEFAULT-DESELECTS the already-`registered` files; the
 * write itself stays idempotent (a re-merge of the identical entry is
 * byte-for-byte), so a re-run is a no-op the recap reports as "unchanged" — the
 * same state-awareness `setup skills` has always had.
 *
 * And it asks, for each group, whether the file could be WRITTEN at all —
 * `probeWritable`, before a single write is composed. A NixOS or home-manager
 * user whose config directory is managed produced a `failed` row carrying a
 * raw `EACCES` and no next step, on a machine configured exactly as its owner
 * intends; that is now a named skip whose remedy is the entry itself, printed
 * through the same serializer the write would have used, for the user to put
 * in the config that owns the directory.
