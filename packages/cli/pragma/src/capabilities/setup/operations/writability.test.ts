/**
 * `probeWritable` — the pure half, driven entirely over its `FsProbe` seam.
 *
 * Every branch here decides whether a row REPORTS a named skip or attempts a
 * write that fails with a raw fs message, and two of them cannot be arranged
 * for real: a test process running as root can write to a `0o500` directory,
 * and no CI host has a `/nix/store`. So the filesystem is three injected
 * functions and each rule is asserted against a fixture that spells out the
 * machine it stands for.
 *
 * The fixture factory is stateful (it records the walk), so it lives in
 * `testing/helpers/fsProbe.ts` and is shared with the setup and doctor suites
 * rather than copied into each.
