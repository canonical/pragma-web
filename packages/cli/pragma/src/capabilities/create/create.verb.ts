/**
 * The `create` verbs — `component` / `package` / `application`, the THREE
 * binding-level VerbSpecs (the MCP/covenant/reference grammar). Their params
 * DERIVE mechanically from the generators' own prompts, projected at build
 * time into `createSurface.generated.ts` — no hand mirrors, no flag aliases:
 * the prompt names ARE the param/MCP-arg names, the FLAG tokens are
 * `buildOptionInfo`'s registered forms (a default-true confirm registers
 * ONLY `--no-<kebab>` — the covenant and the doc gate speak that vocabulary
 * through the mount's registered-syntax seam, L-CIS-2), and `component`'s
 * params are the FRAMEWORK UNION of its three declared leaves plus a
 * required, positional `framework` enum derived from the tree segments
 * (L-CIS). The CLI mounts the
 * generator TREE itself (`create component react [component-path]` — see
 * `mount.ts`); these specs are what MCP tools and the emitted surface read.
 *
 * LAZY DISPATCH (R9 + lazy-React): NOTHING of summon-core is imported
 * statically — not even the UI-free projection subpath: this module sits on
 * the capabilities barrel, so `--help` and `__complete` pay its import cost
 * on every spawn, and the projection helpers it needs (`decideInteraction`,
 * `refusalMessage`, `toKebabCase`, …) are only ever called inside `run`.
 * `run` lazily `import()`s `pickGenerator` + summon-core + the projection, so
 * `buildProgram` / `--help` / `__complete` / reads never load summon-core or
 * the generators — and `create --yes` never loads React. The lazy-graph
 * guard in `lazy.test.ts` pins the boundary.
