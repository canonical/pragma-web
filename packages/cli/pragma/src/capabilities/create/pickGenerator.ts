 * `bun build --compile` it left the generators out of the artifact entirely
 * (`Cannot find module '@canonical/summon-component'`). The declaration decides
 * WHICH generator runs; it cannot decide which module is reachable.
 *
 * The maps' `generate` is invariant in its (specific) answer type, so they are

 * calls `generate(answers)` with the resolved answers, which carry the fields
 * the specific generator reads.
