/**
 * PROTECTED — the shipped-entry `create` guard.
 *
 * Spawns the EMITTED entry the published package points at
 * (`node dist/src/bin.js`) and asserts every `create` noun writes a tree
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL to a source run of the same generator (`bun src/bin.ts …`).
 * The source run is the reference: it reads the `.ejs` templates from disk with
 * no indirection.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. Until the distribution stopped shipping a
 * `bun build --compile` executable, this guard covered `create component` only,
 * and its sibling describe pinned the REFUSAL of `create package` /
 * `create application`: those generators call `template({ source })`, summon-core
 * fell through to `readFile(options.source)`, and inside the binary's virtual
 * filesystem that died with `ENOENT … /$bunfs/templates/package.json.ejs` after
 * `mkdir` had already run — a half-made package on the user's disk. The gate
 * existed to turn that crash into a clean refusal.
 *
 * There is no virtual filesystem now. Every generator's templates are real
 * files under its own package, so all four nouns run from the shipped entry and
 * all four are asserted here. THE REFUSAL CASES ARE GONE ON PURPOSE: a test
 * asserting `create package` refuses would now be asserting a defect.
 *
 * The svelte + lit cases stay load-bearing: `types.ts.ejs` / `index.ts.ejs` /
 * `styles.css.ejs` / `stories.ts.ejs` exist in react/, svelte/ AND lit/, so a
 * basename-matching regression could emit the WRONG framework's file. A wrong
 * file differs from the source run → red here.
