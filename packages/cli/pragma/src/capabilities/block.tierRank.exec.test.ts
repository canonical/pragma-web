/**
 * Which block a SHARED name means, EXECUTED against the shipped pack
 * (PROTECTED).
 *
 * 25 of the design system's block names are carried by two or three blocks
 * apiece, across tiers. `block lookup` used to answer each of them with whichever
 * IRI sorted first and say nothing about the rest, so `button` returned
 * Launchpad's Button — `apps_launchpad…` sorts before `global…` — and an agent
 * had no way to learn that the block everybody means also existed.
 *
 * Two properties, both asserted here: EVERY block the name reaches comes back,
 * and they come back RANKED. Either alone leaves a caller stuck — a better
 * arbitrary pick is still arbitrary, and an unordered list of two makes the
 * reader do the ranking the graph already knows how to do.
 *
 * This suite is deliberately NOT fixture-backed, and that is the whole point of
 * it. The two nearest specimens in this package show why: `journeys.livePack`
 * is NAMED for ordering determinism and its fixture contains one Button, and
 * the ambiguity fixture in `blockGraph.ts` pits two tiers that do not outrank
 * each other, so neither graph can be wrong about the ranking in the way the
 * live graph was. A fixture written alongside a ranking rule agrees with the
 * rule by construction. The shipped pack does not.
 *
 * So every case here READS the collisions out of the store it is judging. There
 * is no list of block names in this file to fall out of date — add a tier
 * upstream, rename one, retire a duplicate, and these assertions follow.
