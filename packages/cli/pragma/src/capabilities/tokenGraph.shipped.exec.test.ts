/**
 * The `token` and `variable` stories, EXECUTED against the shipped pack
 * (PROTECTED).
 *
 * `token.parity.test.ts` and `variable.parity.test.ts` assert the stories'
 * semantics over fixture graphs this repository authors. That is a real check,
 * but a fixture obligingly asserts whatever the story reads — it can prove the
 * story agrees with the fixture and nothing about the corpus a release actually
 * ships. So this file boots the shipped graph and asserts the two things a
 * fixture structurally cannot.
 *
 * FIRST, that every graph term the two stories name is DEFINED by the shipped
 * ontology. Defined, not asserted, and the difference is the whole point: a
 * term the ontology never defines is a story bug that can never render, on any
 * entity, on any install — the defect that let `block lookup` publish no usage
 * narrative for every block on every install, silently, because a name that
 * maps onto no property is exactly what OPTIONAL parity swallows. A term the
 * ontology defines that no instance asserts yet is a content gap and not this
 * suite's business.
 *
 * SECOND, the corpus INVARIANTS the two nouns' addressability rests on: that
 * every symbol and every variable carries exactly one name literal, that the
 * dash-stripping which makes a variable typable is injective and collides with
 * no symbol name, and that a resolved value carries exactly one of a chain or a
 * derivation. Each of those is a property of the whole population, so each is
 * asserted as a count of VIOLATIONS being zero rather than as a row count the
 * next upstream release would move. The populations themselves are deliberately
 * not pinned: upstream adds symbols, and a test that failed because it did
 * would be a test of the wrong thing.
