/**
 * Build the `sources update` Task.
 *
 * Two modes, chosen by `runtime.mutation.preview`:
 *
 * - Preview (CLI `--dry-run`, or MCP without `confirm`): NETWORK-FREE. It reads
 *   only the config, then hands back a plan-only Task listing the refs it would
 *   resolve+build and the pointer it would write — no git fetch, no compile, no
 *   cache write. This is what a dry-run / agent "preview" must be: side-effect
 *   free and offline-safe.
 * - Real execution: the heavy work — resolve every configured pack (git
 *   clone/fetch, file verify, npm resolve), then build the ONE combined
 *   content-addressed pack — runs eagerly (it is not expressible as a task
 *   effect: the effect set is fs + exec, and the in-process compile is not an
 *   effect at all). The returned Task models the mutations: the active-pack
 *   pointer write (undo restores or removes the prior pointer) and the package
 *   skill symlinks.
 *
 * Pinning a revision is the ref's job, not a flag's: put a SHA in the source
 * (`git+https://…#<sha>`) and every update resolves to exactly that commit.
