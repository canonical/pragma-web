/**
 * The `sources update` verb — resolve the configured packs, build the store,
 * and point the project at it.
 *
 * A mutation (`mutates: true`) that needs the network (`needsNetwork: true`)
 * but NOT the pre-booted store (`needsStore: false`): update is what *creates*
 * the store, so the dispatcher must not try to boot it first (a cold boot would
 * throw STORE_UNAVAILABLE). `run` returns a `Promise<Task<R>>` — the union's
 * third arm — which the dispatcher awaits: for a real execution it resolves and
 * builds before handing back the pointer-writing Task; for a preview
 * (`runtime.mutation.preview`) it stays network-free and hands back a
 * plan-only Task.
