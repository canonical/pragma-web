/**
 * The `sources status` verb — a storeless read.
 *
 * `needsStore: false` is load-bearing: status must report even a cold or
 * unbuilt store (`store: "unavailable"`), so it must NOT boot the store —
 * booting a cold store would throw STORE_UNAVAILABLE before status could say
 * so. Its `run` is a lazy thunk (the collector is dynamic-imported), keeping
 * the config reader off the fast path, exactly like `info`.
