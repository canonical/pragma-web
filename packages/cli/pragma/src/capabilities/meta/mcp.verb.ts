/**
 * `mcp serve` — the MCP server entry point.
 *
 * The server is not an agent tool, so it is withheld from MCP with a reason —
 * but it IS a command, and it is spelled like one: a noun and a verb, the same
 * shape as every other pair in the grammar, so it completes, appears in help,
 * and answers `--help` without a special case. The bin still short-circuits
 * the exact `pragma mcp serve` invocation before flag parsing and first-run,
 * because the server's stdout carries JSON-RPC and nothing else may reach it;
 * this spec's lazy `run` is that same serve, for any tier that dispatches it.
