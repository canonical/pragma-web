/**
 * The `upgrade` verb spec (noun `upgrade`, self-verb).
 *
 * A storeless, network-touching mutation: check the registry, then run the
 * package-manager update. `destructive: false` is load-bearing (D4) — upgrading
 * replaces the binary, it destroys no user data — so `annotationsFor` emits
 * `destructiveHint: false` rather than letting MCP clients default an unset hint
 * on a non-read-only tool to `true`.
 *
 * `run` returns `Promise<Task<UpgradeData>>` (async registry read before the
 * effects are known) presented through the `Task<R>` arm by the honest cast —
 * the `update.verb.ts` precedent; a literal `Promise<Task>` union arm would
 * poison async read-verb inference.
