/**
 * The MCP resource browser — a `pragma:{+uri}` template over the pack index.
 *
 * Listing and autocomplete are STORELESS: they read the enriched `index.json`
 * (readPackIndex) off disk, so the resource surface costs nothing until an agent
 * reads one. They read it for the pack the BOOT DECISION names, so the listing
 * can never advertise entities whose reads then fail STORE_UNAVAILABLE. A read
 * is STORE-BACKED through the SHARED {@link readEntity} — the same reader
 * `graph inspect` uses — so a resource read and a `graph inspect` of the same
 * URI return identical content (the mirror contract).
 *
 * The listing is CURATED, not paged. MCP has a `cursor`/`nextCursor` contract
 * for `resources/list`, but the SDK's high-level `McpServer` list handler
 * ignores `request.params.cursor` and never returns a `nextCursor` (verified on
 * the wire against 1.27.1), so "list everything, the client will page it" means
 * "send everything, every connect". Listing all 712 indexed entities cost an
 * agent ~155 KB of context before it had asked a single question. So a module
 * DECLARES the slices of the index it contributes ({@link McpListable}) and the
 * listing is their union: the collections, plus the schema that describes them.
 * The individuals stay fully reachable — by the `{+uri}` template, whose
 * autocomplete still offers every one of them.
 *
 * Degradation (Risk4): on a missing or legacy (pre-v2) index the listing returns
 * a single "run `pragma sources update`" hint — never a live re-index of the
 * store on the resource path. That hint is itself READABLE (it is the only
 * resource a cold server advertises, and an advertised resource that refuses to
 * be read is worse than no resource at all).
 *
 * The MCP SDK's `ResourceTemplate` is dynamic-imported inside `register` so this
 * module — reachable on the capabilities import graph — never pulls the SDK onto
 * the `--help`/`__complete` fast path.
