/**

 * list/autocomplete are storeless over the enriched pack index; a read is

 * never enter the emitted tool surface. On a missing/legacy index the listing
 * degrades to a `pragma sources update` hint (never a live re-index) — and that
 * hint is itself readable.
 *
 * The listing is CURATED, not paged: the SDK's `McpServer` list handler ignores
 * `cursor` and never returns `nextCursor`, so everything listed is sent on every

 * enforces — the perf pass spawns `dist/src/bin.js` and measures CLI latency
 * only. Payload SIZE is the property that actually regressed (712 entries /
 * ~155 KB on every connect), and it is the one an agent pays for twice: once in
 * transfer, once in the context window it can no longer spend on the task.
 *
 * **Raised from 60,000 to 100,000 on 2026-09-01**, when the
 * `@canonical/token-ontology` pack took the payload to 65,119 bytes. The
 * listing was kept whole rather than trimmed to fit: the per-class counts are
 * how an agent gets the shape of the graph before spending a single lookup,
 * and that is worth more than the bytes.
 *
 * **Cost scales with the number of T-Box terms and their metadata, not with
 * the number of packs.** The `ontology` noun emits one resource per matching
 * T-Box entity (`provider.ts`), so a pack costs what its own vocabulary
 * costs — this one happened to add ~23 KB, which is a fact about this
 * ontology and not a rate. The headroom here does not convert into "one more
 * pack" of any size.
 *
 * It is also the only listing that grows this way: every other noun lists
 * collections with their counts, so those grow with the number of nouns. When
 * this ceiling is next reached, the fix is to scope the T-Box slice or
 * paginate it — not to raise the number again, which would turn a gate into a
 * formality.
 *
 * It is deliberately not removed. The regression it was written for is still
 * worth catching, and a ceiling with headroom catches it while a deleted one
 * catches nothing.
