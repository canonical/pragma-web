# Setup and health

Reads work from the moment the package is installed — nothing on this page is required before your first `pragma block lookup`. What `pragma setup` adds is the environment around them: tab completion for your shell, the MCP registration that gives AI agents the same graph, agent skills, and the LSP extension. `pragma doctor` then verifies all of it, and names the fix for anything broken.

## The wizard

`pragma setup` is one wizard over five installers:

| Step | What it installs | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | Your global config file, filled in with the defaults | global |
| `completions` | The TAB-completion script for the shell you are running — zsh, bash, or fish | global |
| `lsp` | The Terrazzo design-token extension, into your VS Code-family editors — VS Code, VS Code Insiders, VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity | global |
| `mcp` | A pragma MCP server entry in each AI harness config file | global and local project |
| `skills` | A symlink for each installed skill, into every harness that reads them | global and local project |

```bash
pragma setup
```

The run has three phases:

1. **Detection, first and for real.** Which shell you run, which AI harnesses are present, which config files already carry a pragma entry. A step the wizard cannot detect a target for is not offered — an unrecognized `$SHELL` means no completions step, no error.
2. **Selection and recap.** On a terminal you pick the steps from a multiselect, then review a recap of the exact effects — every file write, symlink, and command — before anything is applied.
3. **Apply**, with live progress.

Non-interactively — `--yes`, CI, or any run without a terminal — every offered step runs with its defaults, no questions asked.

Re-running is safe. Each installer reads the prior state of what it would write: a file that already matches is skipped and reported unchanged, one that drifted is updated, one that is missing is created. `pragma setup` after an upgrade is the supported way to refresh everything at once.

## Global and local project

Setup writes into two places: **global** — files in your home directory, which is the default — and the **local project**, meaning files in the repository you are standing in, like `.mcp.json`. `--scope project|global|both` chooses between them, with two shorthands:

```bash
pragma setup --local
pragma setup --global
```

`--local` configures this project only; `--global` configures your home directory.

VS Code-family editors keep a **per-user** `mcp.json` beside their settings, so the default global run covers them — VS Code, VS Code Insiders and VSCodium each have their own. `--local` writes the project's `.vscode/mcp.json` instead, which all three read. Passing `--local` used to be the only way to reach VS Code at all; it is a choice about scope again, not a workaround.

The per-user file has to be EARNED by something about the machine: one of the row's own user-level probes — its configuration directory, its extensions folder, or its CLI on `PATH` — has to have matched. A committed `.vscode/` directory travels with the repository, so on its own it writes the project file and nothing per-user; otherwise every contributor who cloned such a repo would get a VS Code config created for them, VS Code installed or not. Under WSL the VS Code family keeps no per-user file at all: the editor you drive there is the Windows one, which reads `%APPDATA%\Code\User\mcp.json` on the Windows side, so the project `.vscode/mcp.json` is the location that works.

Scope narrows what the wizard offers, not only where it writes: completions and the editor extension are global only, so `--local` leaves them out and says so on their rows; project skills are per-project, so `--global` leaves those out; MCP works either way, so its config files are filtered to the scope you chose.

The same two places carry pragma's own configuration — `pragma config show` prints the resolved config and marks which layer supplied each field:

```bash
pragma config show
```

## Preview with `--dry-run`

Every setup command is plan-first: `--dry-run` prints the plan and applies nothing, and `--undo` reverses a previous apply. From a real run, with paths shortened against the two roots the header names:

```console
$ pragma setup --dry-run
Setup plan — global (home: ~ · project: /home/you/src/app)

  config       install    ~/.config/pragma/config.json
  completions  install    zsh → ~/.zfunc/_pragma
  lsp          no change  codium — VSCodium
  mcp          install    ~/.claude.json · ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json · ~/.gemini/settings.json
  skills       link       9 skills → 2 folders (~/.claude/skills, ~/.agents/skills)

Dry run — nothing applied.
```

The middle column is what the row will do. When nothing will happen it says so — `no change` for something already correct, `nothing to do` for something there is nothing to act on — and the column beside it says why.

## One step at a time

Each installer is also a command of its own:

```bash
pragma setup mcp
pragma setup completions
pragma setup skills
pragma setup lsp
```

**`setup mcp`** registers the pragma MCP server in every AI harness it detects — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, VS Code, VS Code Insiders, VSCodium, and others. Each write targets one config file; where two harnesses share a file, each one's entries are preserved. Detection classifies every target file up front — no pragma entry yet, already configured, or drifted — and on a terminal an already-configured file is deselected by default, so a re-run offers to fix drift rather than rewrite what is current. Every run opens by naming what it detected — detected targets only, or the whole table under `--verbose` — and where there is more than one config file it then asks which of them to configure, each listed with its own state (`add`, `update`, `unchanged`). Pressing enter keeps the defaults, which configure every file that needs it. `--scope`, `--global`, and `--local` apply here too:

```bash
pragma setup mcp --scope project
```

**`setup completions`** installs the completion script at your shell's standard path. It is detection-only — the shell comes from `$SHELL`, and a byte-identical script already in place is left alone. Restart your shell to activate.

**`setup skills`** links each installed skill into each harness's skills folder (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, …), reporting every link as created, skipped, or replaced. With nothing to link it says so — and says where skills come from, so the row is not a dead end.

**`setup lsp`** installs the Terrazzo design-token extension into your VS Code-family editors. Each editor is found one of three ways, and every row says which: its CLI on `PATH`, its CLI inside its application bundle under `/Applications` or `~/Applications` (macOS installs put nothing on `PATH` until you run "Shell Command: Install '<cli>' command in PATH" from the command palette), or its per-user configuration directory. An editor found only by that directory has no launcher to install with, so its row is a named skip whose `next:` line is the palette command. With no such editor anywhere, the row skips and says which CLIs it looked for and where, rather than offering a command for a binary you do not have.

An extensions folder that is Nix-managed or read-only is a named skip too, not a failure: the write is never attempted, and the `next:` line carries what does work there — the VSIX path and a home-manager declaration, or the folder to make writable. An editor whose extension is ALREADY installed reports `no change` even when its folder is managed: the copy is there and works, and the block only means this command cannot change it.

## Nix / home-manager

Setup decides by the **directory**, never by the OS. A writable path is written as usual; a path that resolves into `/nix/store` — or that refuses to be written — is a named skip with the remedy that works there, and the run still exits 0.

**A managed extensions folder.** `~/.vscode/extensions` under home-manager is a symlink into the store, so `--install-extension` cannot add to it. There is no marketplace listing for the extension yet, so the remedy declares the bundled VSIX:

```nix
programs.vscode.profiles.default.extensions = [
  (pkgs.vscode-utils.buildVscodeExtension {
    name = "terrazzo-lsp-extension";
    # The one attribute to fill in: the `version` of the package the fetch
    # above put in the staging directory (read it from its `package.json`).
    version = "<version>";
    vscodeExtPublisher = "canonical";
    vscodeExtName = "terrazzo-lsp-extension";
    vscodeExtUniqueId = "canonical.terrazzo-lsp-extension";
    # The VSIX the skip's `next:` line names, fetched with
    # `bun add @canonical/terrazzo-lsp-extension@latest`. Quoted, through
    # `builtins.path`: a bare Nix path literal cannot carry the `@` in
    # `@canonical/…`.
    src = builtins.path { path = "/path/to/terrazzo-lsp.vsix"; };
  })
];
```

**A managed MCP config.** A `mcp.json` that resolves into the store is skipped the same way, and the `next:` line prints the exact entry a write would have emitted — so pasting it into your own config leaves `pragma doctor` reporting the harness as registered rather than as drift:

```json
{ "servers": { "pragma": { "command": "pragma", "args": ["mcp", "serve"] } } }
```

A read-only path that is not in the store reports as read-only, and its remedy is about permissions instead: make the folder writable, then run the step again.

Codex keeps its config in TOML, so a managed `config.toml` gets its entry in TOML rather than JSON — the dotted-key inline table, which is the same entry the writer's `[mcp_servers.pragma]` table holds:

```toml
mcp_servers.pragma = { command = "pragma", args = ["mcp", "serve"] }
```

## `pragma doctor`

`pragma doctor` runs its checks and prints one row each, with the next step inline wherever there is one. It needs no store — the one store check boots lazily and a broken store never aborts the run — so it works before you have built anything.

```console
$ pragma doctor
## Doctor

- ✓ **Node version**: v24.3.0
- ✓ **pragma version**: v0.35.0 (installed via bun (global))
- ✓ **pack refs**: shipped with the CLI — 4 packs, 657 entities · run `pragma sources update` to build from your own configured packs instead
- ✓ **store**: 657 entities in 158ms
### Global

- ✓ **config**: ~/.config/pragma/config.json — valid
- ◇ **completions**: pragma answers `<TAB>`; the zsh script is not installed
  - _fix:_ `pragma setup completions`
- ✓ **lsp**: installed in VSCodium
- ◇ **mcp**: not registered in any of 3 config files
  - ◇ ~/.claude.json: not registered
  - _fix:_ `pragma setup mcp`
- ✓ **harnesses**: 3 detected · 0 registered
  - ◇ Claude Code: detected, not registered — ~/.claude.json
### Local project

- ○ **mcp**: not registered for this project — per-project registration is opt-in
- ○ **skills**: nothing to link — this project holds no skills (./.pragma/skills does not exist)
  - _next:_ add a skill at ./.pragma/skills/<name>/SKILL.md, then run this again

_8 passed, 0 failed, 2 available, 2 skipped_
```

Abridged — long paths are shortened to `~` and some sub-items are cut.

Four tiers, not two. **pass** is fine, **fail** is broken and worth your attention, **available** is an optional integration you have not switched on yet, and **skip** is a row with nothing to act on — a fresh install is healthy with several `available` rows, and counting those as failures would only teach you that the failure count is noise. Every fail and available names the command that settles it under `fix:`; a skip that has a real next step on this machine names it under `next:`.

The report groups its findings under **Global** and **Local project**, matching setup's two scopes — a failing row's section tells you which of the two to re-run setup in.

| Row | What it checks | What it names |
|---|---|---|
| Node version | The runtime is a supported major (20+) | Install a supported Node.js |
| pragma version | The version, and how it was installed | — (informational) |
| pack refs | The pack answering reads is the one your config asks for — a project that declared its own packs but never built them fails here, and a pack an older CLI built (which the shipped snapshot now answers in place of) is named here | `pragma sources update` |
| store | The store boots; reports entity count and boot time | `pragma sources update` |
| config | The global config file exists and parses | `pragma setup config` |
| completions | The installed script exists, is current, and is wired into the shell | `pragma setup completions` |
| lsp | The Terrazzo extension is present in each editor found, and how each was found | `pragma setup lsp` |
| mcp | Each config file carries a current pragma entry, and the command it names is on `PATH` | `pragma setup mcp` |
| skills | Every skill is linked into each harness that reads them | `pragma setup skills` |
| harnesses | A listing, not a verdict: which AI harnesses are on this machine, and whether pragma is registered in each | — (the `mcp` row owns the fix) |

Every row except `harnesses` is named after the setup target that repairs it, so the row name is also the argument you type: `✗ mcp` sits above `fix: pragma setup mcp`.

Doctor always exits 0 — failures live in the report (and in the `failed` count of `--format json`), so scripts read the data rather than the exit code:

```bash
pragma doctor --format json
```

## Version and updates

`pragma info` reports the version, install provenance, the resolved configuration, the entity total, and whether a newer release exists; `pragma upgrade` updates the CLI itself using whichever package manager installed it:

```bash
pragma info
pragma upgrade
```

## Where next

- [The design system graph](./design-system.md) — what all of this gives you access to.
- [MCP integration](./mcp-integration.md) — what the registered server offers an agent.
- [Command & tool reference](./reference/index.md) — every setup and doctor flag.
