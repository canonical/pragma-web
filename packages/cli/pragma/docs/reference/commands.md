# CLI command reference

Every `pragma` command, grouped by noun. Generated from the live capability grammar — do not edit by hand.

Global flags apply to every command: `--format <plain|llm|json>` (auto-detected — the llm/condensed-Markdown form turns on when output is piped), `--verbose`, `--no-headers`, `--quiet`, and `--detail <summary|standard|detailed>`.

## block

### pragma block list

List all design system blocks.

List all design system blocks with their type, tier, and modifier families. Use when browsing which blocks exist. Example: block_list {}.

```
pragma block list [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--tier` | `<string>` | Read this tier and its ancestors (default: the top-level tiers; "all" for every tier). |
| `--limit` | `<number>` | Maximum rows to return, 1 to 40000 (default 300). |
| `--after` | `<string>` | Continue from a previous page: the cursor that page reported. |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `block_list` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma block list
pragma block list --format llm
```

### pragma block lookup

Look up block details by name, IRI, or glob.

Get detailed information about one or more design system blocks including anatomy, modifiers, and properties. Use when you need the full spec of specific blocks by name — detail: "summary" trims to the base view. Example: block_lookup { name: ["Button"] }.

```
pragma block lookup <name...> [options]
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name...>` | yes | Block names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--tier` | `<string>` | Read this tier and its ancestors (default: the top-level tiers; "all" for every tier). |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `block_lookup` tool.

## capabilities

### pragma capabilities

Discover pragma conventions, the annotated tool catalog, and the discovery sequence.

Storeless orientation for agents. Returns the conventions (KG / tier-channel / SPARQL model), a four-stage discovery sequence, and every live tool with a behavioural use_when hint and category — all derived from the live grammar, so it never drifts. Call it first at session start.

```

```

## colophon

### pragma colophon

Narrate how the active domain is made.

Storeless — the colophon each active pack declares for its domain. With no pack telling a story, it prints the one pragma declares for itself instead; with neither, it says so. Also available as a condensed Markdown narration for agents, or as a structured JSON projection of the sections.

```
pragma colophon
```

- Store: storeless.
- MCP: exposed as the `colophon` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma colophon  # the active domain's story

```

## config

### pragma config get

Print one resolved config value.

Reads the effective value of a single field after layering — built-in defaults, the global config, and the nearest project config. Prints the bare value (nothing when the field is unset), so the output substitutes directly into a shell.

```
pragma config get <key>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<key>` | yes | The config field to read. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |

- Store: storeless.
- MCP: exposed as the `config_get` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma config get tier
pragma config get channel --format json
```

### pragma config set

Set a config field by name.

Write a global config field by name. `key` is one of `tier`, `channel`, or `detail`; clearing a field is `config unset <key>`'s job, and the values that used to double as clear-markers are refused. Written to the global layer only — project configs are authored by hand.

```
pragma config set <key> <value>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<key>` | yes | The config field to write. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |
| `<value>` | yes | The value to write. |

- Store: storeless.
- Mutation: plan-first — preview with `--dry-run`, apply with `--yes`, reverse with `--undo`.
- MCP: exposed as the `config_set` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma config set tier apps/lxd  # scope reads to a tier
pragma config set channel experimental
pragma config unset tier  # clear the tier
```

### pragma config show

Show the resolved config and per-field provenance.

Merges built-in defaults, the global XDG config, and the nearest pragma.config.ts, marking which layer supplied each value.

```
pragma config show
```

- Store: storeless.
- MCP: exposed as the `config_show` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma config show
pragma config show --format json
```

### pragma config unset

Clear a config field by name.

Removes a field from the global config so the built-in default (or a project config) applies again. The counterpart of `config set` — setting writes a value, unsetting removes one; no value doubles as a remove-marker.

```
pragma config unset <key>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<key>` | yes | The config field to clear. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |

- Store: storeless.
- Mutation: plan-first — preview with `--dry-run`, apply with `--yes`, reverse with `--undo`.
- MCP: exposed as the `config_unset` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma config unset tier  # read the full graph again
pragma config unset channel
```

## create

The `create` surface is a PROJECTION of the summon generator tree: `pragma create <path...>` ≡ `summon <path...>` over the declared bindings — same grammar, same flags, same wizard, byte-identical trees. Tree segments are subcommands (`create component react|svelte|lit`, `create application react`), and every flag derives from the generators' own prompts (a default-on confirm registers only its `--no-` form). The contract is EXECUTED, not written down: `crossCli.subprocess.test.ts` runs both CLIs over the same argv and compares what they emit.

### pragma create application

| `--rendering` | `<ssr\|spa>` | Rendering — ssr keeps the server layer (SSR servers and sitemap), spa is client-only. (one of: ssr, spa) (default: ssr) |
| `--relay` | — | Include a Relay (GraphQL) data layer with a local mock schema. (default: false) |
| `--no-run-install` | — | Install dependencies now. (default: true) |

## doctor

### pragma doctor

Check your environment and every setup target, globally and in this project.

Reports the environment checks first, then one row per setup target — once for your home directory, once for this project. Each row is pass, fail, available (an optional integration you have not set up yet), or skip (nothing to do here, and the row says why), with the next step printed inline. Every row is named after the setup target that repairs it, except `harnesses`: a listing, per scope, of the AI harnesses found on this machine and whether this CLI's MCP server is registered in each — the ones actually found, or every harness it knows about under the verbose global flag. Needs no store; the store check boots lazily and never fails the run.

```
pragma doctor
```

- Store: storeless.
- MCP: exposed as the `doctor` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma doctor
pragma doctor --format json  # machine-readable checks
```

## graph

### pragma graph connect

Show the shortest relation paths between two entities.

Finds every shortest path of RELATION edges between two entities, and says which kind of nothing it found when there is no path. An edge counts as a relation only where it does not fan out into a roster — membership of a class, a tier or a family is answered by that noun's list verb, not by a path — so most pairs are correctly reported as unconnected. Address each endpoint by prefixed name (ds:global.component.button) or absolute IRI. Every answer states the hop limit, the fan-in threshold, and the packs searched.

```
pragma graph connect <a> <b> [options]
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<a>` | yes | The first endpoint — a prefixed name or absolute IRI. |
| `<b>` | yes | The second endpoint — a prefixed name or absolute IRI. |

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--hops` | `<number>` | Largest path length to return (default 4, ceiling 6). (default: 4) |
| `--paths` | `<number>` | Most shortest paths to show (default 10); the answer always reports the true total. (default: 10) |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `graph_connect` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma graph connect ds:global.component.button dt:color.text  # a block and a token symbol

```

### pragma graph inspect

Show every triple where a URI is the subject, grouped by predicate.

```

## sources

### pragma sources status

Report which pack answers reads, and the packs it was built from.

Storeless — reads config and the pack cache without booting the store, so it works even when the store is cold. Reports whether reads are answered by a locally built pack, by the embedded snapshot, or not at all.

```
pragma sources status
```

- Store: storeless.
- MCP: exposed as the `sources_status` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma sources status  # human-readable readiness summary
pragma sources status --format json  # the full envelope
```

### pragma sources update

Resolve configured packs and build the local store from them.

Resolves each configured pack (git, file, or npm) and builds one local pack from them, which every later run reads without touching the network. Put a commit SHA in a pack source ref to pin it to that revision.

```
pragma sources update [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--skip-invalid` | — | Build from the sources that parse, warning about each one that does not, instead of failing the whole update. |

- Store: storeless.
- Mutation: plan-first — preview with `--dry-run`, apply with `--yes`, reverse with `--undo`.
- MCP: exposed as the `sources_update` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma sources update  # resolve and build
pragma sources update --skip-invalid  # build from the sources that parse, and name the ones dropped
```

## standard

### pragma standard categories

List all standard categories with counts (a parent counts its whole branch).

List all code standard categories with the number of standards each covers. Categories are a hierarchy: a parent's count includes every descendant, and `standard_list { category }` answers for the same set. Use this to pick a valid slug before filtering. Example: standard_categories {}.

```
pragma standard categories [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--limit` | `<number>` | Maximum rows to return, 1 to 40000 (default 300). |
| `--after` | `<string>` | Continue from a previous page: the cursor that page reported. |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `standard_categories` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma standard categories
pragma standard categories --format llm
```

### pragma standard list

List all code standards.

List code standards: one ROW per standard — its IRI, name, category and description — not the standards themselves. Take a row's `name` VERBATIM to standard_lookup for the dos and donts. Optionally filter by category slug (a parent slug answers for its whole branch; standard_categories lists them) or by search term. Example: standard_list { category: "react" }.

```
pragma standard list [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--category` | `<string>` | Filter by category slug. A parent category answers for its whole branch. |
| `--search` | `<string>` | Search in name and description. |
| `--limit` | `<number>` | Maximum rows to return, 1 to 40000 (default 300). |
| `--after` | `<string>` | Continue from a previous page: the cursor that page reported. |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `standard_list` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma standard list
pragma standard list --format llm
```

### pragma standard lookup

Look up one or more standards by name, IRI, or glob. --detail standard adds the dos, --detail detailed adds the don'ts.

Get one or more code standards in full, with dos and don'ts as code examples. `detail` DEFAULTS to "summary", which returns neither: pass detail: "standard" for the dos and detail: "detailed" for dos AND don'ts. Address a standard by the name standard_list publishes (`react/component/tsdoc`), by prefixed name (`cs:react.component.tsdoc`), by absolute IRI, or by a glob over any of those. Example: standard_lookup { name: ["react/component/tsdoc"], detail: "detailed" }.

```
pragma standard lookup <name...>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name...>` | yes | Standard names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `standard_lookup` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma standard lookup <name>
```

### pragma standard sample

Return randomly selected complete standard instances as exemplars for shape discovery.

Return 1–5 randomly selected complete code standard instances as exemplars. Use BEFORE writing queries to see actual data shapes, property names, and value formats. Each call returns different instances. Example: standard_sample { count: 2 }.

```
pragma standard sample [count]
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[count]` | no | Number of samples (1–5, default 2). |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `standard_sample` tool.

**Examples**

```bash
pragma standard sample
pragma standard sample 3
```

## tier

### pragma tier list

List all tiers in the design system ontology.

List all tiers in the design-system ontology. Use when picking the tier to read with: the `tier` parameter scopes a read to one tier plus its ancestors, and this list is never scoped itself. Example: tier_list {}.

```
pragma tier list [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--limit` | `<number>` | Maximum rows to return, 1 to 40000 (default 300). |

```bash
pragma tier list
pragma tier list --format llm
```

### pragma tier lookup

Show tiers by name, with the blocks scoped to each.

Get one or more tiers by name, with the blocks scoped directly to each. Use when you need which blocks a specific tier carries. Example: tier_lookup { name: ["apps/lxd"] }.

```
pragma tier lookup <name...>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name...>` | yes | Tier names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |

```

## token

### pragma token consumers

List which blocks consume which token symbol, at which style key, state and rank.

List the token BINDINGS the design system records — which block consumes which symbol, at which style key, state, rank and node. Every column is identity: two bindings differing only in state are different facts. Name the symbol by its dotted name (symbol) or by a CSS variable standing for it (variable). Answers empty until the packs record bindings. Example: token_consumers { variable: "color-text" }.

```
pragma token consumers [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--symbol` | `<string>` | Filter to one symbol. |
| `--variable` | `<string>` | A CSS variable name for the consumed symbol — the other spelling of the symbol parameter. A channel variable and its semantic sibling differ. |
| `--key` | `<string>` | Filter to one style key. |
| `--state` | `<string>` | Filter to one interaction state. |
| `--search` | `<string>` | Search block, symbol, key, state and node. |

```
pragma token list [options]
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--type` | `<string>` | Filter by type. |

pragma token list
pragma token list --format llm
```

### pragma token lookup

Look up one or more token symbols by dotted name, IRI, or glob.

Get one design-token symbol in full: its own type and description, every definition behind it with that definition's own type and description, the modifier families that may rebind it, and the value it resolves to at each position. Address it by the dotted name token_list publishes (`color.text`), by prefixed name, by IRI, or by a glob. Example: token_lookup { name: ["color.text"] }.

```
pragma token lookup <name...>
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name...>` | yes | Token names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).

**Examples**

```bash
pragma token lookup <name>
```

### pragma token sample

```
pragma token sample
```

- Store: reads the local store (`pragma sources update` builds it).
- MCP: exposed as the `token_sample` tool.

**Examples**

```bash

```

### pragma token values

List the value each symbol resolves to at each position, with its chain or its derivation.

List the resolved token VALUES — one row per (symbol, position) the graph materialises, with the value and either its resolution chain or the symbol it derives from. Only MATERIALISED positions appear, not the permutation space: a position with no row falls through to the base symbol. A derived row carries a derivation and no value cell. Example: token_values { symbol: "color.text" }.

```

pragma upgrade
pragma upgrade --dry-run  # show the delta and the command
```

## variable

### pragma variable chain

List the walk from a variable to every symbol it reaches, through every variable in between.

List the resolution WALK: every (variable, symbol) pair a variable reaches through what its declarations reference, transitively — what a variable finally means. The closure runs over every declaration of every hop, so one variable can reach dozens of pairs. Example: variable_chain { variable: "modifier-color-text" }.

```

### pragma variable list

List the platform variables the design tokens are emitted as.

List the platform VARIABLES a stylesheet declares as CSS custom properties, with the symbol each stands for, its tier, visibility and the coordinates it is selected at. 236 stand for no symbol, so token_list cannot reach them. Address one WITHOUT its leading dashes (`color-text`). Example: variable_list { symbol: "color.text" }.

```
