# MCP tool reference

Every tool the pragma MCP server exposes, plus its non-tool surface. Generated from the live capability grammar — do not edit by hand. The server's `serverInfo` is a projection, not a constant: it introduces itself on the wire under the distribution's declared name at the package version, so a client should read `serverInfo` rather than assume a name.

Mutating tools are plan-first: called without `confirm: true` they return the plan they WOULD apply; called with `confirm: true` they execute. A mutating tool also accepts an optional absolute `cwd`.

### block_list

List all design system blocks with their type, tier, and modifier families. Use when browsing which blocks exist. Example: block_list {}.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### block_lookup

Get detailed information about one or more design system blocks including anatomy, modifiers, and properties. Use when you need the full spec of specific blocks by name — detail: "summary" trims to the base view. Example: block_lookup { name: ["Button"] }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string[] | yes | Block names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |
| `detail` | enum(summary, standard, detailed) | no | Progressive-disclosure level (default detailed). |

### block_sample

Return randomly selected complete design-system blocks as exemplars. Use BEFORE writing queries to see actual data shapes, anatomy, and property names. Example: block_sample {}.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### capabilities

Storeless orientation for agents. Returns the conventions (KG / tier-channel / SPARQL model), a four-stage discovery sequence, and every live tool with a behavioural use_when hint and category — all derived from the live grammar, so it never drifts. Call it first at session start.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### colophon

Storeless — the colophon each active pack declares for its domain. With no pack telling a story, it prints the one pragma declares for itself instead; with neither, it says so. Also available as a condensed Markdown narration for agents, or as a structured JSON projection of the sections.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### concept_list

List design-system concepts — long-form foundations, how-to guides, and decision guides not bound to a single UI block. Optionally filter by type or search. Example: concept_list { type: "Explanation" }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | no | Filter by concept type (e.g. Explanation, How-to guide). |
| `search` | string | no | Search in name and summary. |

### concept_lookup

Get a design-system concept's full Markdown documentation. Address concepts by the name concept_list publishes, by prefixed name (ds:concept.…), by absolute IRI, or by a glob. Example: concept_lookup { name: ["Foundations: Grid"] }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string[] | yes | Concept names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |
| `detail` | enum(summary, standard, detailed) | no | Progressive-disclosure level (default standard). |

### config_get

Reads the effective value of a single field after layering — built-in defaults, the global config, and the nearest project config. Prints the bare value (nothing when the field is unset), so the output substitutes directly into a shell.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | enum(tier, channel, detail) | yes | The config field to read. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |

### config_set

Write a global config field by name. `key` is one of `tier`, `channel`, or `detail`; clearing a field is `config unset <key>`'s job, and the values that used to double as clear-markers are refused. Written to the global layer only — project configs are authored by hand.

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply).

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | enum(tier, channel, detail) | yes | The config field to write. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |
| `value` | string | yes | The value to write. |
| `confirm` | boolean | no | Set true to execute; otherwise a plan is returned (default false). |
| `cwd` | string | no | Absolute project directory to write into; defaults to the server's working directory. |

### config_show

Merges built-in defaults, the global XDG config, and the nearest pragma.config.ts, marking which layer supplied each value.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### config_unset

Removes a field from the global config so the built-in default (or a project config) applies again. The counterpart of `config set` — setting writes a value, unsetting removes one; no value doubles as a remove-marker.

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply).

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | enum(tier, channel, detail) | yes | The config field to clear. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |
| `confirm` | boolean | no | Set true to execute; otherwise a plan is returned (default false). |
| `cwd` | string | no | Absolute project directory to write into; defaults to the server's working directory. |

### doctor

Reports the environment checks first, then one row per setup target — once for your home directory, once for this project. Each row is pass, fail, available (an optional integration you have not set up yet), or skip (nothing to do here, and the row says why), with the next step printed inline. Every row is named after the setup target that repairs it, except `harnesses`: a listing, per scope, of the AI harnesses found on this machine and whether this CLI's MCP server is registered in each — the ones actually found, or every harness it knows about under the verbose global flag. Needs no store; the store check boots lazily and never fails the run.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### graph_connect

Finds every shortest path of RELATION edges between two entities, and says which kind of nothing it found when there is no path. An edge counts as a relation only where it does not fan out into a roster — membership of a class, a tier or a family is answered by that noun's list verb, not by a path — so most pairs are correctly reported as unconnected. Address each endpoint by prefixed name (ds:global.component.button) or absolute IRI. Every answer states the hop limit, the fan-in threshold, and the packs searched.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | string | yes | The first endpoint — a prefixed name or absolute IRI. |
| `b` | string | yes | The second endpoint — a prefixed name or absolute IRI. |
| `hops` | number | no | Largest path length to return (default 4, ceiling 6). (default: 4) |
| `paths` | number | no | Most shortest paths to show (default 10); the answer always reports the true total. (default: 10) |

### graph_inspect

Inspect one entity: all predicate/object pairs asserted on the subject. Address it by prefixed name (ds:global.component.button) or absolute IRI.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | string | yes | The subject URI — a prefixed name or absolute IRI. |
| `detail` | enum(summary, standard, detailed) | no | Progressive-disclosure level (default standard). |

### graph_query

Executes an arbitrary SPARQL query (SELECT / ASK / CONSTRUCT) against the store. Prefixes are applied automatically from the pack's namespace map; list the ontology namespaces to discover the available prefixes.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sparql` | string | yes | The SPARQL query text (SELECT, ASK, or CONSTRUCT). |

### implementation_libraries

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### implementation_list

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### prompt_list

Browse the prompt entities the active graph declares (ds:Prompt in this distribution) — name, description, and argument names. This distribution's graph carries none today. The same prompts are offered natively over MCP prompts/list; use prompt_lookup for the full template body.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### prompt_lookup

Fetch a single prompt entity's full template body (with {{arg}} placeholders) and its declared arguments. A prompt is addressed by its label; prompt_list names the ones the active graph carries.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | The prompt name, as `prompt list` reports it. |

### setup

Shows what each target needs, then applies the ones you keep. Everything is configured in your home directory by default; the scope option moves the run to this project alone, or covers both. Without an attended terminal the plan is printed and nothing is written unless the run is explicitly confirmed.

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply). Non-destructive.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Show a skill's metadata and instructions by name.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | The skill name. |

### sources_status

Storeless — reads config and the pack cache without booting the store, so it works even when the store is cold. Reports whether reads are answered by a locally built pack, by the embedded snapshot, or not at all.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### sources_update

Resolves each configured pack (git, file, or npm) and builds one local pack from them, which every later run reads without touching the network. Put a commit SHA in a pack source ref to pin it to that revision.

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply).

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skipInvalid` | boolean | no | Build from the sources that parse, warning about each one that does not, instead of failing the whole update. |
| `confirm` | boolean | no | Set true to execute; otherwise a plan is returned (default false). |
| `cwd` | string | no | Absolute project directory to write into; defaults to the server's working directory. |

### standard_categories

List all code standard categories with the number of standards each covers. Categories are a hierarchy: a parent's count includes every descendant, and `standard_list { category }` answers for the same set. Use this to pick a valid slug before filtering. Example: standard_categories {}.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### standard_list

List code standards: one ROW per standard — its IRI, name, category and description — not the standards themselves. Take a row's `name` VERBATIM to standard_lookup for the dos and donts. Optionally filter by category slug (a parent slug answers for its whole branch; standard_categories lists them) or by search term. Example: standard_list { category: "react" }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `category` | string | no | Filter by category slug. A parent category answers for its whole branch. |
| `search` | string | no | Search in name and description. |

### standard_lookup

Get one or more code standards in full, with dos and don'ts as code examples. `detail` DEFAULTS to "summary", which returns neither: pass detail: "standard" for the dos and detail: "detailed" for dos AND don'ts. Address a standard by the name standard_list publishes (`react/component/tsdoc`), by prefixed name (`cs:react.component.tsdoc`), by absolute IRI, or by a glob over any of those. Example: standard_lookup { name: ["react/component/tsdoc"], detail: "detailed" }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### standard_sample

Return 1–5 randomly selected complete code standard instances as exemplars. Use BEFORE writing queries to see actual data shapes, property names, and value formats. Each call returns different instances. Example: standard_sample { count: 2 }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `count` | string | no | Number of samples (1–5, default 2). |

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply). Non-destructive.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `confirm` | boolean | no | Set true to execute; otherwise a plan is returned (default false). |
| `cwd` | string | no | Absolute project directory to write into; defaults to the server's working directory. |

## Non-tool surface

- **Resources**: `pragma:{+uri}` — entity reads addressed by URI (listing and autocomplete are storeless over the pack index). The template — its scheme and the `_meta` taxonomy keys its entries carry — is frozen protocol identity, served unchanged by every distribution: clients persist resource URIs, so the scheme never follows a fork's name.
- **Prompts**: the workflow prompt templates the active graph declares are offered natively over `prompts/list` and `prompts/get`, and as the `prompt_list` / `prompt_lookup` content tools. A graph declaring none leaves both views empty.
- **Instructions**: the server always sends handshake instructions describing the conventions and the discovery sequence.
