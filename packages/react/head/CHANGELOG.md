# [0.38.0](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/compare/v0.37.0...v0.38.0) (2026-09-16)

* feat(react-head)!: render head tags so server rendering emits them (#1192) ([76ac99d](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/76ac99dde1d80790d8ac518c485548831a69c26a)), closes [#1192](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1192)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `useHead`, `createHeadCollector`, `HeadTags` and
  `HeadCollector` are gone, and `HeadProvider` no longer takes a `collector`.
  `HeadMeta` and `HeadLink` survive as the elements own props rather than
  hand-written attribute lists, so a page can declare the preload, icon and
  hreflang links the old shapes rejected.
  Replace a `useHead({ title, meta, link })` call with a `<Head title meta link />`
  element rendered by the page, and move any per-page title suffix into the root
  `<HeadProvider titleTemplate={…}>`. A `deps` array has no successor and needs
