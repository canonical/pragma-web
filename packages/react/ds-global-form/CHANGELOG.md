* **react-ds-global-form:** refine choice options, toggle fields and label markers ([#1242](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1242)) ([38c7e71](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/38c7e71781c9c428db9a2be0d2dd4611389c693f))
* **tokens:** follow the focus-ring rename and rebuild the embedded graph ([#1183](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1183)) ([ca2cbef](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/ca2cbefa9cb903778d8e40d13732d8a56a244274))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* @canonical/utils no longer exports debounce, throttle,
  humanizeNumber, pluralize, the HumanizeNumberOptions, HumanizeResult and
  PluralizeOptions types, the AllOrNone type, or any navigation export —
  annotateTree, createNavigationReducer, findAncestorPath,
  getFirstInteractiveChild, getItemId, getLastInteractiveChild, getParentItem,
  isInteractive, prepareIndex, resolveOrientation, NavigationActionType, and the
  NavigationAction, NavigationReducerOptions, NavigationState, NodeStatus,
  Orientation and OrientationConfig types. They are now exported, unchanged, from
  @canonical/ds-utils. Consumers change the import specifier and add
  @canonical/ds-utils as a dependency; no call site changes.
* a form control's colour and border transitions now last 165ms
  instead of 150ms, and a combobox list item's 165ms instead of 100ms. Nothing
  about the resting rendering changes — only how long a colour, a border or the
  switch knob takes to settle — but the numbers are different, so an application
  that has tuned its own timings against these should re-check them. There is no
  150ms motion token to read; the nearest named step is the fast one, 0.165s.
* An application must add `ds` to its root, beside the context
  and density classes it already carries — `<html class="ds app comfortable">`.
  Without it the reset applies nowhere, because it is now confined to the marked
  subtree, and the page's text falls back to the browser's defaults. Components
  are unaffected: each carries `ds` on its own root. Two further consequences: an
  application's unlayered CSS now beats every rule this package ships, where
  before it competed with unlayered rules by source order, so an override that
  used to lose now wins and one that used to win still does; and `normalize.css`
  is no longer a transitive dependency, so an application that was relying on the
  parts of it this package does not use must depend on it directly. To keep the
  layer order in force for your own CSS, put it in a layer of your own above
  ds.components.app — the README's "Migrating to the layered release" section has the
  statement to copy.

  `@canonical/react-ds-global-form`, whatever the selectors on either side,
  because unlayered author rules outrank every layered one. An application that
  overrides a form control with a plain rule keeps winning, and wins more easily
  than before. An application that relied on this package's rules beating its own
  must move its CSS into `@layer app`, which sits above `ds.components.global` in
  the order `@canonical/styles` declares. The package's rules also no longer
  outrank the styles package's own layers, which is the point of the change.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ds-global-form:** the 'simple-choices'/'choices' inputType strings and the
.ds.form-* class names change, so consumers selecting these via <Field> or
theming the classes must update.

tsc + biome + full suite (236) pass; storybook builds.

* refactor(storybook-config): upstream the ontology-tier story order

Move the sidebar story order from ds-global-form's local preview override into
the shared @canonical/storybook-config, so every Storybook orders by ontology
tier: Documentation, subcomponents, components, patterns, common, utils, and a
trailing _work_in_progress folder for not-yet-tiered stories.

Drop the non-folder entries from the order list — the nested
[Introduction, Getting Started, Guides] docs sub-array (docs order is out of
scope here) and the '*' wildcard — since every story is foldered. ds-global-form
now inherits the order and no longer overrides storySort locally.

Replaces the previous maturity order (Stable/Beta/Experimental) shared config
default; this changes the sidebar order for all consumers.

check passes for both packages; form storybook builds against the rebuilt config.
