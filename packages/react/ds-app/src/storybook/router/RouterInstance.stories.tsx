/**
 * Single-instance smoke probe for the shared router decorator.
 *
 * `withHashRouter` lives in `@canonical/storybook-addon-utils` and renders
 * `RouterProvider`; this story's component calls `useRouter()` from
 * `@canonical/router-react` as a *consumer* package would. Provider and
 * consumer therefore have to resolve the SAME `@canonical/router-react` module
 * instance — if the addon and the story ever close over two copies (a stale
 * peer range that makes a strict package manager install a second router, or a
 * workspace symlink Vite fails to dedupe), they get two distinct React context
 * objects, the context reads empty and `useRouter()` throws
 * "RouterProvider is required to use router-react hooks."
 *
 * So the story rendering at all IS the proof; the play function only turns that
 * into an explicit assertion for Chromatic/test runs.
