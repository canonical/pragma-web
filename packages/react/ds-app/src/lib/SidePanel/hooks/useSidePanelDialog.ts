  // 1. `panelRef.current.close()` — the handle closes it, and its close
  //    handler already handed focus back. This effect then has nothing to do
  //    (openRef is already false, so it bails out below).
  //
  // 2. The panel is unmounted while open — nobody called close(), React just
  //    removed it. The typical case is navigation: the user moves to another
  //    route and the whole subtree, panel included, goes away. (A consumer
  //    conditionally rendering the panel — `{isOpen && <SidePanel …/>}` —
  //    also lands here, though the mounted-always pattern is the intended
  //    one.) Focus is sitting on an element that no longer exists, so the
  //    browser dumps it on <body>, and a keyboard user lands in the middle of
  //    nowhere. This cleanup catches that case and puts focus back where it
  //    was before the panel opened — usually the button that opened it.
