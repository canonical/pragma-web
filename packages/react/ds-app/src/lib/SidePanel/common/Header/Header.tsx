 * Header for SidePanel. Required: its title is the panel's accessible name,
 * so a panel is not complete without one. Never scrolls: it stays visible
 * above `SidePanel.Content`, which scrolls on its own.
 *
 * Owns the title the panel is labelled by, and the close button — which is
 * wired through context, so rendering this outside a SidePanel yields a plain
 * title rather than an error.
 *
 * The title is not a heading element: headings structure the page's document
 * outline, and a panel opens from anywhere in it, so no heading level would be
 * right everywhere. The title names the panel through `aria-labelledby`
 * instead, which is what a screen reader announces when the panel opens.
