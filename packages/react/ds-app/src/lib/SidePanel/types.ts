 * Do not set the native `open` attribute — it is omitted from the surface
 * precisely so the panel's bookkeeping (focus handoff) cannot be bypassed.
 *
 * Props extend the native props of the `<dialog>` root, so every attribute it
 * accepts (data-*, aria-*, event handlers, …) reaches the DOM. That includes
 * the dialog's own `onClose`: pass your own to hear about every close,
 * whatever caused it. The panel's bookkeeping
 * runs after the handler.
 *
 * The panel is always named by its header's title, so `children` must include
 * a `SidePanel.Header` — the provider warns in development when it does not.
