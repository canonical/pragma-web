/**
 * A panel docked to the inline-end edge of the viewport, for work that
 * accompanies the current view rather than interrupting it.
 *
 * Structurally, the component is a context provider that renders the panel's
 * markup: it wraps the `<dialog>` in the context its composed parts read,
 * and keeps every piece of panel behaviour — open/close bookkeeping, focus
 * handoff, the imperative handle — in `useSidePanelDialog`.
 *
 * It renders a **non-modal** `<dialog>` opened with `show()`, so the
 * application behind stays clickable and tabbable.
 *
 * The panel is controlled through its `ref`: `open()` shows it and moves focus
 * in, `close()` hides it and hands focus back. The ref is required, since the
 * handle is the only way in — a panel with no ref is a panel that can never
 * open. The dialog's native open state is the single source of truth — there
 * is no `open` prop to mirror it.
 *
 * The panel forwards the native dialog `onClose`: pass your own to hear about
 * every close, whatever caused it — the handle's `close()`, Escape, or anything else.
 *
 * Compose the body from `SidePanel.Header`, `SidePanel.Content` and
 * `SidePanel.Footer`. The panel lays them out as a flex column: header and
 * footer keep their size, and the content pane takes the rest and scrolls
 * within it. The content pane is a tab stop, so keyboard users can scroll it;
 * opening the panel still focuses the panel itself, so from there Tab reaches
 * the close button, then the content, then the footer's actions.
 *
 * There are two consumption patterns, `withSidePanel` and `SidePanel`.
 * `withSidePanel` is meant for static content: the call belongs at module
 * scope, where the function it is handed can only see module-level values, so
 * the panel it returns is the same on every render. If the panel must show
 * data from the parent — for example a different machine's details depending
 * on which machine is selected — compose `SidePanel` directly and drive it
 * through its `ref`. Otherwise, use `withSidePanel`.
 *
 * The panel is always named by its header's title, so the header is required
 * — a panel composed without one gets a development warning. Note the title
 * is not a heading element: the panel is a layer on top of the page, not
 * part of its document outline.
 *
 * The panel is `position: fixed` and therefore out of the document flow: an
 * `overflow: hidden` ancestor does not clip it
 *
 * Because the content pane scrolls and the panel is transformed, a
 * `position: fixed` overlay rendered inside the panel is clipped at the
 * pane's edge and positioned relative to the panel rather than the viewport.
 * `Popover` currently follows that pattern, so keep it within the content
 * pane's bounds.
 *
 * `ContextualMenu` instead portals its surface to `document.body`, escaping
 * this clipping. When it must overlap the panel, give its overlay layer a
 * z-index higher than `--side-panel-z-index`.
 *
 * `import { SidePanel } from "@canonical/react-ds-app";`
