# [0.38.0](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/compare/v0.37.0...v0.38.0) (2026-09-16)

* refactor(react-ds-app)!: wrap the app-tier component stylesheets in their tier layers (#1125) ([0eacf5e](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/0eacf5e6949acbb09618206748164e4c8d48f404)), closes [#1125](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1125)
* refactor(utils)!: move navigation, debounce and throttle to @canonical/ds-utils (#1109), closes [#1109](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1109)

### Bug Fixes

* **deps:** update canonical to v0.10.0 ([#894](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/894)) ([34a1bb9](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/34a1bb987de4677a83c6f6da3a1521f8d26d18ad))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* @canonical/utils no longer exports debounce, throttle,
  humanizeNumber, pluralize, the HumanizeNumberOptions, HumanizeResult and
  PluralizeOptions types, the AllOrNone type, or any navigation export —
  annotateTree, createNavigationReducer, findAncestorPath,
  getFirstInteractiveChild, getItemId, getLastInteractiveChild, getParentItem,
  isInteractive, prepareIndex, resolveOrientation, NavigationActionType, and the
  NavigationAction, NavigationReducerOptions, NavigationState, NodeStatus,
  Orientation and OrientationConfig types. They are now exported, unchanged, from
  @canonical/ds-utils. Consumers change the import specifier and add
  @canonical/ds-utils as a dependency; no call site changes.
* An application must add `ds` to its root, beside the context
  and density classes it already carries — `<html class="ds app comfortable">`.
  Without it the reset applies nowhere, because it is now confined to the marked
  subtree, and the page's text falls back to the browser's defaults. Components
  are unaffected: each carries `ds` on its own root. Two further consequences: an
  application's unlayered CSS now beats every rule this package ships, where
  before it competed with unlayered rules by source order, so an override that
  used to lose now wins and one that used to win still does; and `normalize.css`
  is no longer a transitive dependency, so an application that was relying on the
  parts of it this package does not use must depend on it directly. To keep the
  layer order in force for your own CSS, put it in a layer of your own above
  ds.components.app — the README's "Migrating to the layered release" section has the
  statement to copy.
* An application's own unlayered CSS now beats every rule these
  packages ship, whatever the selectors on either side, because an unlayered
  author rule outranks every layered one. Before, an application override competed
  with these stylesheets by specificity and source order, so an override that used
  to lose now wins; one that used to win still does. An application that does not
  want to win by accident puts its CSS in a layer — `@layer app`, which the styles
  package's statement places above the component tiers. Separately, an app tier's
  rule for a component now beats @canonical/react-ds-global's by cascade layer
  instead of by load order, which is the point of the two tier names: an
  application that was getting the global tier's `.ds.button` because its bundler
  emitted the app tier first will now get the app tier's.
* The layer these packages write into is renamed. An application
  that named `ds.components.app` in its own order statement, or that wrote rules
  into it to sit alongside an application tier, must use the tier's own name
  instead — `ds.components.apps-lxd` and its siblings, or `ds.components.apps` for
  the shared tier. Nothing else about the rules changes.
