/**
 * A modal is a focused container that sits on top of the main view, requiring
 * users to interact with it before returning to that view. Its purpose is to
 * capture the user's full attention for a specific, self-contained task while
 * keeping their workspace visible, though inactive, behind it. The main use
 * case is asking the user to confirm a decision they have already taken — for
 * instance, sending a delete request.
 *
 * It renders a native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, so the backdrop,
 * focus trap, page inertness and Escape handling come from the platform rather
 * than from JavaScript. The modal is self-contained: the open state lives in
 * the `<dialog>` element, not in a prop, so the header's close button and
 * Escape close it — and a backdrop click too, once `closeOnBackdropClick` opts
 * in — without the consumer wiring anything. Opening always goes through the
 * `ref` — which is required, since `showModal()` is the only way in:
 * `ref.current?.showModal()` opens the modal and `ref.current?.close()`
 * closes it.
 *
 * A native dialog opened with `showModal()` renders in the browser's top
 * layer, so even under an ancestor with `overflow: hidden` the modal is not
 * clipped.
 *
 * There are two consumption patterns, `withModal` and `Modal`. `withModal` is
 * meant for static content: the call belongs at module scope, where the
 * function it is handed can only see module-level values, so the modal it
 * returns is the same on every render. If the modal must show data from the
 * parent — for example a different `userName` depending on which user is
 * selected — compose `Modal` directly and drive it through its `ref`.
 * Otherwise, use `withModal`.
 *
 * The header's title names the dialog automatically; a modal composed without
 * a header must carry its own `aria-label` (see the accessibility story in
 * `withModal`).
 *
 * The sections are composed by the consumer: render
 * `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Content` and `Modal.Footer` as children and choose
 * which ones to show. Note the title is not a heading element: a modal is a
 * layer on top of the page, not part of its document outline.
 *
