### BREAKING CHANGES

* @canonical/utils no longer exports debounce, throttle,
  humanizeNumber, pluralize, the HumanizeNumberOptions, HumanizeResult and
  PluralizeOptions types, the AllOrNone type, or any navigation export —
  annotateTree, createNavigationReducer, findAncestorPath,
  getFirstInteractiveChild, getItemId, getLastInteractiveChild, getParentItem,
  isInteractive, prepareIndex, resolveOrientation, NavigationActionType, and the
  NavigationAction, NavigationReducerOptions, NavigationState, NodeStatus,
  Orientation and OrientationConfig types. They are now exported, unchanged, from
  @canonical/ds-utils. Consumers change the import specifier and add
  @canonical/ds-utils as a dependency; no call site changes.
* `_Item<A | B>` now resolves per union member instead of to the
  union's common keys. Code that relied on the collapsed shape must instantiate
  `_Item` with the whole entry union.
* `@canonical/react-ds-global` now declares an `exports` map, so
  the package answers only to the paths it lists: the package name, `./index.css`,
  `./package.json` and any published file under `./dist/` named exactly. Two forms
  that used to resolve no longer do. A folder in place of a file —
  `@canonical/react-ds-global/dist/esm`, or
  `@canonical/react-ds-global/dist/esm/lib/component/Button` — no longer finds the
  `index.js` inside it; name the file. Anything outside `dist` —
  `@canonical/react-ds-global/README.md`, or a `src/…` path that happened to
  resolve in a workspace checkout — now fails with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`;
  those files were never published. Importing the package by name, or the
  stylesheet by its subpath, is unaffected.
* `ContextualMenu`'s `groups: MenuItem[]` prop is replaced by
  `items: MenuEntry[]`, a flat list of menu items and `{ type: "separator" }`
  entries. Migrate by concatenating each group's `items` and placing a separator
  between them.

  The `role="group"` wrappers and their `aria-label`s are gone with the grouped
  model, so labelled sections ("Recent", "All items") can no longer be expressed —
  a separator divides sections visually and for assistive technology, but does not
  name them.

  Removed, the grouped menu being their only consumer: `createCrossGroupStateReducer`
  and `getFirstEnabledLeaf` from `@canonical/utils`; `getMenuGroupProps` and
  `MenuGroupPropsResult` from `@canonical/react-hooks`; `getGroupProps` from
  `useContextualMenu`.
* `Item` requires a `key` or a `url`. Items with neither
  no longer type-check — give a navigable item its `url` and a
  non-navigable one a `key`. Types built on `Item` must use
  `type X = Item & { … }` rather than `interface X extends Item`, and
  `_DistributiveOmit<Item, K>` rather than `Omit<Item, K>`.
  `MenuSeparator.key` is required: write `{ type: "separator", key: "…" }`.
* `MenuSeparator` no longer has a `disabled` field. It was
  documented as set by `useContextualMenu` and never by consumers, so code that
  only builds menus is unaffected; code that read `separator.disabled` should
  read `separator.presentational`.
* a consumer that adds its own class to a `<button class="ds
  button">` and styles it at the component root's specificity, (0,2,0), from a
  stylesheet that loads after this one now wins those declarations, where the
  Button's density seat used to take them whatever the order. The measured case is
  `@canonical/react-ds-global-form`'s combobox reset button, which returns to a
  centred 16px line box (the rendered box stays 40×30) from a left-aligned glyph on
  the density baseline. A consumer that wants the seat to keep winning should not
  re-declare the seat's properties on a `.ds.button`; a consumer that wants its own
  rule to win regardless of order must raise it to (0,3,0), for example by naming
  the component root as well as its own class.
* An application must add `ds` to its root, beside the context
  and density classes it already carries — `<html class="ds app comfortable">`.
  Without it the reset applies nowhere, because it is now confined to the marked
  subtree, and the page's text falls back to the browser's defaults. Components
  are unaffected: each carries `ds` on its own root. Two further consequences: an
  application's unlayered CSS now beats every rule this package ships, where
  before it competed with unlayered rules by source order, so an override that
  used to lose now wins and one that used to win still does; and `normalize.css`
  is no longer a transitive dependency, so an application that was relying on the
  parts of it this package does not use must depend on it directly. To keep the
  layer order in force for your own CSS, put it in a layer of your own above
  ds.components.app — the README's "Migrating to the layered release" section has the
  statement to copy.

  package ships, whatever the selectors on either side, because an unlayered
  author rule outranks every layered one. Before, an application override competed
  with these stylesheets by specificity and source order, so an override that used
  to lose now wins; one that used to win still does. An application that does not
  want to win by accident puts its CSS in a layer — `@layer app`, which the styles
  package's statement places above the component tiers. Separately, an application
  tier's rule for a component now beats this package's by cascade layer rather
  than by load order, which is the point; a tier that was relying on losing that
  race will see its own rule take effect.

  tier's rule for a component now beats this package's by cascade layer rather
  than by load order, which is the point; a tier that was relying on losing that
  race will see its own rule take effect.
* this supersedes the breaking note on the first commit of this
  branch, which described the affected population too widely.

  Only a rule in the same cascade layer changes outcome — `ds.components.global`,
  which holds the global-tier packages. In practice that is one rule today: the
  combobox clear button in @canonical/react-ds-global-form, which goes back to a
  centred 16px line box (its box on screen stays 40x30 pixels). The Svelte
  ds-global package has no `.ds.button` rule at all.

  Nothing outside that layer changes. An application's own stylesheet in
  `ds.components.app` or in `app`, and any unlayered consumer stylesheet, beat the
  Button's seat before this change and beat it after, whatever the load order —
  that is what the layers are for.

  A global-tier package should not redeclare the seat's properties (`line-height`,
  `box-sizing`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, `padding-block`) on a
  `.ds.button` at all: between two sheets in one layer only the emitted order
  decides, and nobody controls that. PRA-153 carries the clear button. A consumer
  who wants their own rule to win should put it in their own layer or leave it
  unlayered, not lengthen its selector.


# [0.37.0](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/compare/v0.36.0...v0.37.0) (2026-09-02)

* feat(react/ds-global)!: extend native props via ComponentProps intersection (#297) (#851) ([4c96482](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/4c96482e5b9eff2a86cdca939a17b1f0374e498f)), closes [#297](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/297) [#851](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/851) [#297](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/297) [#297](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/297) [#628](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/628)

### Bug Fixes

* **react-ds-global:** Fixes `Section` padding being bound to nonexistent tokens ([#926](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/926)) ([f0e8fd4](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/f0e8fd49860e8165f99e5d6b1b693454c35a2c2c))

### Features

* **svelte-ds-global:** Upstream Svelte `Announcement` from WPE tier to Global ([#961](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/961)) ([5bad77e](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/5bad77e66e9da624cee6364ddb3548e95230813e))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `ButtonBaseProps` is no longer exported from
  `@canonical/react-ds-global`. Use `ButtonProps`.
* `ChipPropsType` is removed. `ChipProps` is again the full prop surface —
  import that. 0.37.0 briefly made `ChipProps` the design-system half only,
  which broke references such as `ChipProps["onClick"]`; those resolve again.
  `ChipProps` is a discriminated union on `onClick` (a chip with a handler
  renders a `<button>`, one without renders a `<span>`), so a value assigned
  to it may need narrowing where a single object type was assumed.

* feat(router)!: pre-1.0 API consolidation — one constructor, adapters as the axis, block(), warm() (re-land of #973) (#981) ([416d596](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/416d59636f94cafae7a9fbb0b377edabed6438bf)), closes [#973](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/973) [#981](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/981) [#973](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/973) [#973](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/973) [#973](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/973)

* **svelte-ds-global:** Upstream `SkipLink` from WPE tier to Global tier ([#859](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/859)) ([b1f6b4f](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/b1f6b4fdbc917e027666dcae579b0d87f330b7a2))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* navigate() and setSearchParams() throw on a router
constructed without an adapter instead of doing nothing.

* refactor(router)!: collapse router factories onto the adapter axis

createRouter(routes, { adapter, ... }) is now the one constructor. The
preset factories were one-line sugar over an adapter choice; under the
minimal-API principle the adapter is the whole axis:

- delete createBrowserRouter, createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter and
  createStaticRouter from router-core (the browser adapter already
  resolves Navigation API -> History API internally)
- delete router-react's createHydratedRouter; its __INITIAL_DATA__
  reading survives as readDehydratedState(), passed to createRouter as
  hydratedState — which also removes the incoherence where the hydrated
  path was history-only while createBrowserRouter preferred the
  Navigation API
- migrate every in-repo consumer (boilerplate entries, summon templates,
  storybook harnesses, story-utils) to createRouter + adapters; the
  static-router recipe (match + synchronous hydrate) is inlined at the
  two SSR entry points that used it
* createBrowserRouter, createHashRouter,
createMemoryRouter, createStaticRouter and createHydratedRouter are
removed. Use createRouter(routes, { adapter: createBrowserAdapter() |
createHashAdapter() | createMemoryAdapter(url) | createServerAdapter(url),
hydratedState: readDehydratedState() ?? undefined }).

* refactor(router)!: reshape blockers to router.block() and fix useBlocker reactivity

Five members (registerBlocker/unregisterBlocker/blockerState/
proceedNavigation/cancelNavigation) collapse into one:
router.block(isActive) returns a handle with { state, proceed, cancel,
subscribe, dispose }, backed by a dedicated blocker-state subject.

This also fixes a real bug: useBlocker subscribed to the store, but a
blocked navigate() never touched the store, so the documented
confirmation-dialog pattern never rendered — the old test had to poke
the store manually to observe the blocked state. The hook now subscribes
to the handle and re-renders on the block itself; the dialog pattern is
asserted end-to-end.

Disposing (or unmounting) while blocked discards the pending navigation
— previously implicit, now documented handle behavior.
* registerBlocker, unregisterBlocker, blockerState,
proceedNavigation and cancelNavigation are removed from Router; use
router.block(isActive). The RouterBlocker type is replaced by
RouterBlockerHandle. useBlocker's public shape is unchanged.

* refactor(router)!: shrink the public surface — internal store, one-arg StatusResponse

- Remove store from the public Router interface. It was reachable on
  every router yet documented nowhere, and no production code consumed
  it; the package's own tests reach the concrete object's store through
  an explicit internal accessor instead. createRouterStore and the
  RouterStore type remain exported as standalone primitives.
- StatusResponse's data argument is now optional — new StatusResponse(401)
  works, as the READMEs already wrote.
* Router no longer exposes store. Subscribe via
subscribe/subscribeToNavigation/subscribeToSearchParam, read via
getState/getTrackedLocation.

* refactor(router)!: rename prefetch to warm

'prefetch' imports the wrong mental model: in every other router a
prefetch/loader hands data to the component, and readers kept filing the
hook's fire-and-forget design as a bug. 'warm' says what the hook is
for — warming a cache ahead of navigation — and cannot be confused with
a data loader.

Renamed atomically across router-core (route/wrapper hook, router.warm(),
WarmFn, internals), router-react (Link's hover warm-up), the reference
app and summon templates, and the router docs. TanStack's prefetchQuery
in examples is unrelated third-party API and keeps its name.
* the route/wrapper 'prefetch' hook is now 'warm';
router.prefetch() is router.warm(); the PrefetchFn type is WarmFn.

* fix(router-core): make StatusResponse's optional payload type-safe
