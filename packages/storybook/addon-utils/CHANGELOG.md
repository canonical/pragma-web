### BREAKING CHANGES

* navigate() and setSearchParams() throw on a router
constructed without an adapter instead of doing nothing.

* refactor(router)!: collapse router factories onto the adapter axis

createRouter(routes, { adapter, ... }) is now the one constructor. The
preset factories were one-line sugar over an adapter choice; under the
minimal-API principle the adapter is the whole axis:

- delete createBrowserRouter, createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter and
  createStaticRouter from router-core (the browser adapter already
  resolves Navigation API -> History API internally)
- delete router-react's createHydratedRouter; its __INITIAL_DATA__
  reading survives as readDehydratedState(), passed to createRouter as
  hydratedState — which also removes the incoherence where the hydrated
  path was history-only while createBrowserRouter preferred the
  Navigation API
- migrate every in-repo consumer (boilerplate entries, summon templates,
  storybook harnesses, story-utils) to createRouter + adapters; the
  static-router recipe (match + synchronous hydrate) is inlined at the
  two SSR entry points that used it
* createBrowserRouter, createHashRouter,
createMemoryRouter, createStaticRouter and createHydratedRouter are
removed. Use createRouter(routes, { adapter: createBrowserAdapter() |
createHashAdapter() | createMemoryAdapter(url) | createServerAdapter(url),
hydratedState: readDehydratedState() ?? undefined }).

* refactor(router)!: reshape blockers to router.block() and fix useBlocker reactivity

Five members (registerBlocker/unregisterBlocker/blockerState/
proceedNavigation/cancelNavigation) collapse into one:
router.block(isActive) returns a handle with { state, proceed, cancel,
subscribe, dispose }, backed by a dedicated blocker-state subject.

This also fixes a real bug: useBlocker subscribed to the store, but a
blocked navigate() never touched the store, so the documented
confirmation-dialog pattern never rendered — the old test had to poke
the store manually to observe the blocked state. The hook now subscribes
to the handle and re-renders on the block itself; the dialog pattern is
asserted end-to-end.

Disposing (or unmounting) while blocked discards the pending navigation
— previously implicit, now documented handle behavior.
* registerBlocker, unregisterBlocker, blockerState,
proceedNavigation and cancelNavigation are removed from Router; use
router.block(isActive). The RouterBlocker type is replaced by
RouterBlockerHandle. useBlocker's public shape is unchanged.

* refactor(router)!: shrink the public surface — internal store, one-arg StatusResponse

- Remove store from the public Router interface. It was reachable on
  every router yet documented nowhere, and no production code consumed
  it; the package's own tests reach the concrete object's store through
  an explicit internal accessor instead. createRouterStore and the
  RouterStore type remain exported as standalone primitives.
- StatusResponse's data argument is now optional — new StatusResponse(401)
  works, as the READMEs already wrote.
* Router no longer exposes store. Subscribe via
subscribe/subscribeToNavigation/subscribeToSearchParam, read via
getState/getTrackedLocation.

* refactor(router)!: rename prefetch to warm

'prefetch' imports the wrong mental model: in every other router a
prefetch/loader hands data to the component, and readers kept filing the
hook's fire-and-forget design as a bug. 'warm' says what the hook is
for — warming a cache ahead of navigation — and cannot be confused with
a data loader.

Renamed atomically across router-core (route/wrapper hook, router.warm(),
WarmFn, internals), router-react (Link's hover warm-up), the reference
app and summon templates, and the router docs. TanStack's prefetchQuery
in examples is unrelated third-party API and keeps its name.
* the route/wrapper 'prefetch' hook is now 'warm';
router.prefetch() is router.warm(); the PrefetchFn type is WarmFn.

* fix(router-core): make StatusResponse's optional payload type-safe
