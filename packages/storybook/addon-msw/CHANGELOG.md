### Code Refactoring

* **ds-global-form:** rename SimpleChoicesField→ChoicesField, ChoicesField→RichChoicesField ([#711](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/711)) ([4a4a498](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/4a4a4988a25df45f9f102f2540efa4ac958e82ae))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ds-global-form:** the 'simple-choices'/'choices' inputType strings and the
.ds.form-* class names change, so consumers selecting these via <Field> or
theming the classes must update.

tsc + biome + full suite (236) pass; storybook builds.

* refactor(storybook-config): upstream the ontology-tier story order

Move the sidebar story order from ds-global-form's local preview override into
the shared @canonical/storybook-config, so every Storybook orders by ontology
tier: Documentation, subcomponents, components, patterns, common, utils, and a
trailing _work_in_progress folder for not-yet-tiered stories.

Drop the non-folder entries from the order list — the nested
[Introduction, Getting Started, Guides] docs sub-array (docs order is out of
scope here) and the '*' wildcard — since every story is foldered. ds-global-form
now inherits the order and no longer overrides storySort locally.

Replaces the previous maturity order (Stable/Beta/Experimental) shared config
default; this changes the sidebar order for all consumers.

check passes for both packages; form storybook builds against the rebuilt config.
