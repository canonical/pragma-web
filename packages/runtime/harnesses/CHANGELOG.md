* feat(harnesses)!: AI-harness detection — platform paths, live signals, scope model, dedup + OpenDesign (#867) ([6e0df18](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/6e0df1806cfd1d941c094c4f83a31488c36958cc)), closes [#867](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/867)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `HarnessDefinition` now requires a `scope` field, and
global/both harnesses must declare `homeConfigPath`.

* feat(harnesses): config-target dedup + re-enable Cline (project scope)

Add `configTargets.ts`: `groupConfigTargets` deduplicates detected harnesses'
resolved targets two ways — prompt-dedup by path (one choice per shared file,
labelled with every harness) and write-dedup by (path, mcpKey) (one write per
distinct key, each preserving the other). The scope→band mapping
(`bandsForScope`, `harnessInBand`, `harnessesForBand`, `groupTargetsForScope`)
implements 7f: `both` runs both bands with dual-scope writing project only;
`global`/`project` run a single band. Re-enable Cline (scope project,
mcpKey mcpServers) — it and VS Code both write .vscode/mcp.json under different
keys (VERIFY(7a)). Registry is 9 harnesses.

* fix(harnesses): guard extension glob against a missing extensions dir

Globbing a non-existent `~/.vscode/extensions` throws ENOENT under the real
interpreter, which would abort detection (and every setup/doctor run in a
project without VS Code extensions). Check the directory exists first, else the
extension signal is simply absent.

* feat(harnesses): single-write multi-key writer for shared config files

`writeMcpConfigTargets(targets, name, config)` writes one server entry under
every mcpKey of a group of targets that share ONE file (VS Code `servers` +
Cline `mcpServers` in .vscode/mcp.json) in a SINGLE read-modify-write. This
preserves each key and — crucially — is dry-run safe: two sequential
writeMcpConfigTo calls to the same new file made the second read the file the
first virtually created (mock content → false "unparseable" abort under the
recap preview). `writeMcpConfigTo` now delegates to the shared multi-key core.

* feat(harnesses): add OpenDesign harness (dual-scope) + env map normalization

Add the `opendesign` entry (scope both): detects a `.od` dir or an `od` binary
whose --version identifies OpenDesign (a `verify` guard against the Unix `od`
octal-dump false positive, VERIFY(7g)); project config `.od/mcp-config.json`,
home config `~/.od/mcp-config.json`, skills `.od/skills`, mcpKey mcpServers.
`normalizeEnv: true` forces a written server entry's `env` to a JSON object/map
(OpenDesign rejects a non-map env) via `normalizeOdEnv`, threaded through the
target-based writers. Registry is 10 harnesses.

* fix(harnesses): guard verify-exec, probe PATHEXT on win32, drop Cline false-positive

Address the crash/false-positive review findings on the harness-detection work:

- checkProcess: wrap the `verify` exec in recover(...=>pure(false)) so a spawn
  failure (ENOENT/EACCES, or the probed binary erroring) resolves to an
  unverified `false` instead of rejecting all of detectHarnesses — one harness's
  probe must never crash `setup`/`doctor` (the `od --version` verify runs every
  detection pass).
- checkProcess: probe every PATHEXT suffix on win32, not just `.exe` — npm
  installs CLI harnesses (`claude`, `codex`, `od`…) as `.cmd`/`.bat` shims, which
  an `.exe`-only probe missed entirely on Windows.
- harnesses: detect Cline ONLY by its saoudrizwan.claude-dev extension. The
  `.vscode` directory belongs to VS Code, so keying off it false-detected Cline
  (and wrote an inert `mcpServers` block) in every VS Code project.

harnesses: 184 tests, 100% coverage.

* fix(harnesses): review cleanup — fork detection, darwin config path, dead code, verb-first names

Follow-up review polish on the harness-detection work:

- signals: broaden `checkExtension` to the whole VS Code family — Cursor
  (~/.cursor), VSCodium (~/.vscode-oss), Windsurf (~/.windsurf) alongside stock
  ~/.vscode. Any match counts; each dir is exists-guarded before globbing.
- platformPaths: delete the dead `windowsHostUserBase` (nothing resolved through
  it); fix the darwin `userConfigBase` collision — `~/Library/Preferences`, now
  distinct from the data base (`~/Library/Application Support`); extract the pure
  `buildPlatformEnv` core so the OS-family + WSL branches stay coverage-checked
  and the `v8 ignore` wraps only the live host read; reword the header to be
  honest that 100% coverage proves the code RAN, not that the darwin/win32/WSL
  guesses are correct (real-host validation tracked in AV-287).
- verb-first renames (web-code-standards): signalTier -> toSignalTier,
  bandsForScope -> resolveBandsForScope, harnessInBand -> isHarnessInBand,
  harnessesForBand -> listHarnessesForBand. No external consumers; no aliases.

harnesses: 188 tests, 100% coverage.

* fix(harnesses): match extension dirs by manifest, not directory name

The `glob` effect lists files only, so checkExtension's bare `<id>-<version>`
directory pattern never matched a real extension directory — extension detection
silently never fired. Exposed by making Cline extension-only (it would otherwise
be undetectable). Glob for the `package.json` manifest that every VS Code
extension carries at its root, under each versioned directory, so an installed
extension actually resolves.

harnesses: 188 tests, 100% coverage.
