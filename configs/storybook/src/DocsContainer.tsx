/**
 * Documentation pages render in the preview iframe — a separate document from
 * the manager — so the chrome theme applied by
 * `@canonical/storybook-addon-shell-theme` never reaches them. Left alone they
 * fall back to Storybook's stock light theme, which is why every docs page
 * rendered as unbranded grey regardless of branding or OS setting
 * (canonical/pragma-web#962). This supplies the theme they are missing. The full
 * reasoning is in this package's README.
 *
 * Keep this component in this package. Moving it into the shell-theme addon,
 * where it looks like it belongs, would bundle a SECOND React into that addon —
 * its Vite build externalises `storybook/*` but nothing else — and this
 * component calls a hook, so the duplicate copy raises an invalid hook call.
 *
 * The failure is specifically React, not a lost docs context: addon-docs parks
 * its context on `globalThis.__DOCS_CONTEXT__` (first loader wins) precisely so
 * that duplicate bundles share one instance. React is the singleton that does
 * not survive duplication.
 *
 * Import `@storybook/addon-docs/blocks` statically, not behind `lazy()`. The
 * static import does hoist the docs-blocks graph into the eager preview bundle,
 * which is a real cost — but a `Suspense` boundary here wraps the ENTIRE docs
 * page, because `Docs` passes the page in as `children`. Storybook's
 * render-complete callback sits outside that boundary and fires from a layout
 * effect, so the first docs page would signal `DOCS_RENDERED` while committed
 * empty: Chromatic can snapshot a blank page, and the container's hash-scroll
 * effect finds no anchors. Trimming the eager bundle needs a different approach.
 *
 * Scope: chrome only. Story content theming belongs to
 * `@canonical/storybook-addon-utils`.
