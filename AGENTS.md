# AGENTS.md — Working on a Pragma PR

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) contributing to `canonical/pragma`. For deeper
setup and monorepo mechanics see [`old/CONTRIBUTING.md`](old/CONTRIBUTING.md); this
file is the PR workflow contract.

## Toolchain

- **Bun is required** and is the canonical package manager/runner (`bun install`,
  `bun run <script>`). Node.js `^22.13.0 || ^24.0.0 || ^26.0.0` must also be
  present — the range Lerna requires, and therefore the range the root gate
  runs under. Node 20, 23 and 25 are all excluded: 23 additionally has a known
  compatibility issue. The root `package.json` declares this range, so
  `bun install` warns when the local Node is outside it.
- **npm appears only for first-time package publishing** (`npm publish --access public`
  from inside a new package dir) — never for day-to-day dev. Don't use `npm install`.

## Commits

- **Conventional / semantic commits**, enforced. CI (`.github/workflows/pr-lint.yml`)
  rejects a PR whose **title** is not Conventional-Commits compliant, so the title
  needs a `type(scope): subject` form, e.g. `feat(pragma): …`, `fix(summon): …`,
  `docs(tokens): …`, `chore(deps): …`, `refactor(cli): …`.
- **Keep commits atomic.** One logical change per commit; the diff should be reviewable
  on its own and tell a single story. Bundling unrelated items into one commit/PR is
  allowed but should be **rare** and called out in the PR body (a "drive-by" line).
- The allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `ci` and
  `revert`; the **type label** is derived from the title by CI, so never add one by hand.
  A breaking change is marked with `!` in the title (`feat(router)!: …`), which is what
  applies the `breaking` label. Every other label is a human judgement — see
  [docs/references/LABELS.md](docs/references/LABELS.md).
- The release CHANGELOG is Lerna-generated from commit history — write commit subjects
  for the changelog reader, not just yourself.

## Branches & worktrees (local development)

- **Branch names follow `type/semantic-description`** — the `type` matches the
  conventional-commit types (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, …) and
  the description is kebab-case and meaningful, e.g. `feat/minor-cli-improvements`,
  `fix/storybook-subpath-imports`. Every branch carries a `/`.
- **Work in a git worktree, not by switching the main checkout.** Create one per branch
  under `.claude/worktrees/`. Name the worktree directory after the branch, with the
  `/` replaced by `-` (a `/` can't be a single path segment). So:

  ```bash
  # branch feat/minor-cli-improvements  →  worktree dir feat-minor-cli-improvements
  git worktree add -b feat/minor-cli-improvements \
    .claude/worktrees/feat-minor-cli-improvements origin/main
  ```

  This keeps each line of work isolated, lets several proceed in parallel, and leaves the
  main checkout untouched. Branch from an up-to-date `origin/main`. Note a fresh worktree
  has no `node_modules` — run `bun install` inside it before the first `check`/`test`.

## Where to run commands

- **Before pushing, always run the full gate from the repo ROOT.** Root scripts fan out
  across every affected package via Lerna (with Nx caching), so the root is the only
  place that covers the whole change. Per-package runs can miss cross-package breakage.
- **During focused development**, it's fine to run a single package's scripts from inside
  that package dir (`cd packages/<area> && bun run check`/`test`) for a faster loop —
  but the root run is the gate of record before pushing.

## Pre-push checklist (run from the repo root, in order)

```bash
# 0. clean install if deps changed (the prepare hook builds linked packages)
bun install

# 1. lint + format + type-check + architecture rules, every package
bun run check          # → lerna run check  (biome + tsc --noEmit + webarchitect)

# 2. if check reports fixable issues, apply and re-run check
bun run check:fix      # → lerna run check:fix

# 3. tests, every package
bun run test           # → lerna run test  (vitest run)

# 4. only if the change affects build artifacts / a publishable package
bun run build          # → lerna run build   (dev/link build)
# full artifact build (Storybook, docs, etc.) is a CI concern via each
# package's build:all; run locally only when validating release artifacts
```

A change is push-ready when `bun run check` and `bun run test` both pass from the root.
That mirrors what CI runs, so green locally → green CI (modulo Chromatic visual review
and environment-only tests). If a single test fails for environment reasons unrelated to
the diff, confirm it fails the same way on a clean `origin/main` before discounting it.

> **Do not treat per-package green as push-ready.** CI runs `check`/`test` across **all
> ~53 projects** via Nx, so a change can break a *dependent* package you didn't touch (a

> than a CI round-trip.

## Revising before pushing to a PR

CI round-trips are expensive — get the branch right locally first.

1. **Sync to a moved base before pushing.** `git fetch origin main`; if the branch is
   behind, **rebase** (never merge) onto `origin/main`. The lockfile is the usual conflict:
   resolve `bun.lock` by regenerating (`bun install`) — never hand-merge it — and commit
   the regenerated lockfile.
2. **Re-run the full root gate after the rebase**, not just before. A rebase replays your
   commits onto new code: a lint rule, biome version, or coverage threshold that moved on
   `main` can now fail commits that were green on the old base.
3. **Tidy the history.** Reword `WIP`/`fix typo` commits into Conventional-Commit subjects
   and squash noise (`git rebase -i origin/main`) so each commit is atomic and the
   Lerna-generated CHANGELOG reads cleanly. Do this *before* the first push when possible.
4. **Push safely.** First push: plain `git push`. After a rebase/reword (history rewrite):
   `git push --force-with-lease` — it refuses if someone else pushed to the branch
   meanwhile (then rebase on their work first). Never plain `--force`.
5. **Watch the actual CI run** after pushing. Green locally is necessary, not sufficient:
   pull the failing job's log (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`), fix at the source, and
   repeat from step 2. Don't push speculative "maybe this fixes CI" commits.

**Gotchas this repo has actually hit:**
- A biome **version bump** without updating `"$schema"` in a `biome.json` → `biome check`
  fails to deserialize. Keep the schema string in lockstep with the `@biomejs/biome` version.
- Trading a lint violation for coverage (e.g. a `!` non-null assertion to drop an
  uncovered `?? ""` branch) trips `noNonNullAssertion`. Rewrite to satisfy **both**
  (e.g. iterate `Map.entries()` instead of `keys()` + `get()`).
- A **new package** needs a first manual `npm publish --access public` (a human step,
  npm 2FA) before release automation works — merging it does not make it releasable.

> Per-package `check` = `check:biome` (lint+format) → `check:ts` (`tsc --noEmit`) →
> `check:webarchitect` (architecture ruleset). `check:fix` auto-fixes biome then
> re-runs tsc. Every package must define `check`, `check:fix`, and `test`; packages
> with build steps also define `build` and `build:all`.

## Conventions

This is a **convention-heavy monorepo**. Most conventions are documented — in
`old/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/`, the package-folder-structure doc, and the
`pragma-adrs` repo (the `session/I.*` "Pragma Maturity" decisions). **When unsure how
something should be structured, look for the existing convention first** — read a
sibling package/domain and match its layout, naming, error handling, and test
placement — rather than inventing a new pattern. Match the surrounding code's idioms;
a new file should be indistinguishable in style from its neighbours.

### The documentation site depends on the runtime, never the reverse

`packages/prism/*` and the documentation-site app are the site layer. They may
depend on anything below them — `packages/runtime/*`, `packages/cli/*`,
`packages/summon/*`, and the component packages.

**Nothing in those depended-upon packages may depend on `packages/prism/*` —
not even as a devDependency.** The usual pressure to reverse the arrow is a
conformance check: the site authors a contract, and it is tempting to have the
package that must satisfy the contract assert that it does. That is the package
marking its own homework, and it costs it a dependency on the site it exists to
be independent of. Site-side packages hold those gates instead, reading whatever
they need to read.

Nothing enforces this, so it is a review obligation: a new `@canonical/prism-*`
entry in a manifest under `packages/runtime/`, `packages/cli/`,
`packages/summon/` or a component package is a change to challenge, whatever it
is for.

### Module imports — use relative paths, not `#` subpath aliases

Do **not** use `#`-prefixed `package.json` `"imports"` (Node subpath imports) for
package-internal modules in packages we build and publish with `tsc`. `tsc` never
rewrites module specifiers, so a `#alias` written in source is emitted **verbatim**
into `dist`. The published package then leaks its private `imports` map as part of
its public contract: every consumer's bundler/test-runner has to resolve those `#`
specifiers itself, and mismatched resolve conditions (for example Vite/Vitest
activating the `development` condition, which points at unpublished `src`) break the
build downstream.

Use ordinary relative imports (`../../subcomponent/Spinner/index.js`) with the `.js`
extension (NodeNext). They need zero config in any consumer and survive `tsc` emit
unchanged.

This applies to every **`tsc`-built** package — the discriminator is the build tool,
not the directory. Most libraries under `packages/` are `tsc`-built and are in scope.
Code that a **bundler** compiles may still use `#` aliases, because the bundler inlines
them so nothing is published verbatim: this covers Vite-bundled apps (`apps/*` and
scaffolded boilerplates) **and** Bun-bundled published packages under `packages/` (e.g.
the CLI at `packages/cli/pragma`). When unsure, check whether the package's build script
runs `tsc` or a bundler.

## CI workflows are global — do not add checks for one package

The CI domain is global, always, without exception. If a package-scoped
concern can earn a workflow step, every package can, and with 60+ packages
that becomes unbearable — the cost of one job is not one job, it is the
precedent.

- **Shared workflows (`pr.yml` and friends) are global infrastructure.** Do
  not add a job or step for a single package's concern. This is not a style
  preference: a new required check applies to every PR in the repo, including
  other teams' and outside contributors'.
- **A package-scoped check rides the package's own `check` / `test` targets.**
  Root `check` is `lerna run check`, which fans out to every package, and the
  build matrix already runs it — so a package target is covered everywhere
  *and* only runs when nx says the package is affected. That is cheaper and
  correctly scoped than a dedicated job.
- **The bar for a shared job is a genuine repo-wide invariant**, not merely
  something that happens to be run from the root.
  `scripts/check-workspace-ranges.ts` earns its shared step because it asserts
  something true of every workspace sibling. One package's data provenance
  does not, however important that package is.
- **If you believe you need a workflow change, say why in the PR body** and
  expect it to be challenged.
### React component props — extend the root element's native props

A React component's props type **must extend the native props of the element it
renders as its root**, so every attribute that element accepts (`data-*`,
`aria-*`, `onMouseEnter`, `id`, `style`, …) reaches the DOM for free. Write it as
a DS-owned `OwnProps` intersected with the root tag's `ComponentProps`, tag-indexed:

```ts
import type { ComponentProps } from "react";

type OwnProps = {
  /* DS-owned props */
};

// Change "button" to the component's actual root element tag.
export type ButtonProps = OwnProps & Omit<ComponentProps<"button">, keyof OwnProps>;
```

Rules:

1. Use **`ComponentProps<"tag">`** — the tag-indexed form. Not the per-element
   `XxxHTMLAttributes<T>` interfaces (easy to mis-instantiate against the wrong
   element), and not `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` (the repo peers React 19, where
   `ref` is an ordinary prop and belongs in the surface).
2. Use a **`type` alias with an intersection**, never `interface … extends`.
   Intersections distribute over unions and compose predictably; `interface
   extends` does not, and mixing it with union members silently collapses props
   to `any` (the `FieldProps` lesson from issue #235).
3. Always `Omit<ComponentProps<"tag">, keyof OwnProps>` so the DS-owned keys win
   by construction. Any *further* exclusion the component deliberately controls
   (e.g. `| "type"` when the DS fixes the button type) gets a doc comment saying
   why.
4. **Runtime obligation:** destructure every `OwnProps` member out, spread the
   remaining `{...rest}` onto the root element, and set DS-controlled attributes
   *after* the spread so they win. Merge `className`/`style` rather than letting
   either side clobber — the repo pattern is
   `[componentCssClassName, className].filter(Boolean).join(" ")`. No DS-internal
   prop may leak onto the DOM node.
5. **Variable-root components** (the root element depends on a prop) use a small
   discriminated union of two such intersections (issue #628 precedent), one per
   possible root tag. No polymorphic `as` generics.
6. **Components with no single root element** (fragments, portals, pure
   composition/wrappers) are exempt — say so in a one-line doc comment.

## PR mechanics

- Branch from up-to-date `origin/main`; never push to `main` directly — **all changes
  land via PR** on a feature branch.
- Fill in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (Done / QA / readiness checklist).
- **A PR description must stand on its own. Never cite an internal planning
  document in it** — no ADR rung numbers, session ledgers, `pragma-adrs` paths, or
  any other coordinate into a repo the reader may not be able to open. Outside
  contributors and other teams review these PRs; sending them looking for a
  document they do not have access to costs them time and tells them nothing. A
  citation is not a reason. State what the change does and why, in full, in the PR
  itself. The same goes for commit subjects, which Lerna puts in the CHANGELOG.
  Internal sequencing stays in the planning repo; when merge order matters, name
  the PR that must land first **by number** and say why in one line.
- Add `Chromatic: skip` to skip Chromatic when there's no visual diff.
- New package? First-time publish is manual (`npm publish --access public` from the
  package dir); verify with `bun run publish:status` from the root.
- **New packages need OIDC trusted-publisher setup — a manual human step, agents cannot
  do it.** Automated releases (`tag.yml`) publish via npm OIDC trusted publishing, but a
  trusted publisher *cannot be configured until a package's first publish* (the npm
  settings page doesn't exist yet). So a new package's first publish is manual, and a
  human must then configure its trusted publisher on npmjs.com — until they do, the
  automated workflow cannot publish future versions. Beware: merging a new package does
  not make it releasable on its own. See
  [`docs/how-to-guides/PUBLISH_A_PACKAGE.md`](docs/how-to-guides/PUBLISH_A_PACKAGE.md).
