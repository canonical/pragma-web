# Preface

This file is the entry point for agents and humans working in either pragma repository, `canonical/pragma-core` or `canonical/pragma-web`. It states the rules every change follows and names the topic files that hold the detail. Read it before changing anything in this repository.

The original of this file lives in canonical/pragma-core; canonical/pragma-web carries a copy that links to it. Change the original first, then the copy, in paired pull requests.

Read the top-level `.kb/agents.md` file before continuing below.

# Overview

pragma is built in two repositories. `canonical/pragma-core` holds the toolchain: the `pragma` and `summon` command-line tools and the generators, `webarchitect`, the Biome, TypeScript and Renovate configurations, `utils`, `task`, `ke`, `ke-graphql`, `harnesses`, the design tokens and the design-system models. `canonical/pragma-web` holds everything that renders: the React, Svelte and Lit components, the stylesheets, Storybook, the runtime packages, the applications and the documentation site. Anything that renders belongs to pragma-web, even when a generator in pragma-core emits it.

pragma-web consumes the pragma-core packages from npm, pinned to exact versions. A change to one of them is a pull request in pragma-core; once it is released, pragma-web bumps the pin in every manifest that names it. A change that spans both repositories is two pull requests, and the pragma-core one lands first.

Both repositories are Bun and Lerna monorepos with the same toolchain, the same commit, issue and pull-request rules, and the same CI shape. This file and the topic files listed below are shared: canonical/pragma-core holds the originals, and canonical/pragma-web carries copies that link to them. What is specific to this repository is in `.kb/this-repository.md`.

# Important

- Every change lands through a pull request from a `type/description` branch; nobody pushes to `main` directly.
- A change is push-ready only when `bun run check` and `bun run test` pass from the repository root.
- Pull request bodies and commit subjects stand on their own and cite no internal planning document.
- CI workflows are global: never add a workflow job or step for one package.
- Regenerate `bun.lock` only with the Bun version pinned in `.bun-version`.
- When unsure how something should be structured, look for the existing convention first: read a sibling package or domain and match its layout, naming, error handling and test placement rather than inventing a new pattern. A new file should be indistinguishable in style from its neighbours.
- Comments explain the code, not where it came from. Never leave provenance markers that trace a file back to the spec, DSL, graph or plan it was generated from, such as `{/* DSL edges[0]: content (cardinality: 1) */}`.
