/**
 * The marketing routes: the Home lobby (`/`, AV-350 — the front door, and
 * the last route to come over the graph) and the guide reading detail
 * (`/guides/:slug`, which stays a plain authored page — it has no graph
 * query yet).
 *
 * The lobby builds its `RouteQueryEntry` ONCE (in `lobbyQuery.ts`) and
 * parks it twice per the P-2/P-5 handshake:
 *
 * - `meta[ROUTE_QUERY_META_KEY]` — the server prepare step POSTs the query
 *   to the graph server and serialises the reply into the store
 *   (`prepareRelayData`);
 * - `prefetch` — hover (router-react's `Link`) and the initial hydration
 *   load warm the client store through `warmRouteQuery`.
 *
 * The lobby claims the mode strip's context socket with "Home" — the lens
 * name as the Rail's `LENS_ENTRIES` labels it, matching how every other
 * lens claims its own name. Controls/status stay UNCLAIMED — honestly
 * empty: the lobby has no filters and no status to report.
