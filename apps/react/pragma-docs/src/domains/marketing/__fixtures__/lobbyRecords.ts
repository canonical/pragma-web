/**
 * A serialised Relay store snapshot for `LobbyQuery` at
 * { componentClass: "ds:Component", patternClass: "ds:Pattern",
 *   standardClass: "cs:CodeStandard", exemplars: 6 } — captured VERBATIM
 * from a dev server's `__INITIAL_DATA__.relay.records` at `/`.
 *
 * No trimming (unlike `standardsIndexRecords`): the lobby's whole capture
 * is 17 records — three class lookups, one six-edge instance connection,
 * and the six component nodes it references — which is already reviewable.
 * Every record id and field key is byte-identical to the capture,
 * including the quoted-argument storage keys
 * (`ontologyClass(uri:"ds:Component")`) and the positional edge ids.
 *
 * The counts frozen here (108 components, 41 patterns, 131 standards) are
 * a CAPTURE, not a contract: the graph moves (the 111->108 lesson). Unit
 * tests read them from this fixture; nothing asserts these numbers against
 * the live graph, and the e2e block asserts only structure and floors.
 *
 * Regenerate: boot `dev:bun`, then copy `relay.records` out of the
 * `__INITIAL_DATA__` script served at `/` — wholesale, no editing.
