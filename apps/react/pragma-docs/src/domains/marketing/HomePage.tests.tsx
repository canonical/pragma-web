/**
 * The Home lobby's warm-store proof (the P-2 exit criterion, applied to
 * the front door): a store seeded with the captured fixture renders both
 * projections WITHOUT the network being consulted — with teeth, because
 * the same render against an empty store does hit the network.
 *
 * The numbers are read OUT OF THE FIXTURE, never hardcoded here: the
 * graph moves (the 111→108 lesson), and a recapture must not need a test
 * edit. What IS pinned is that the rendered number equals the fixture's
 * `instanceCount` — the honest-count contract from `lobbyQuery.ts`, whose
 * whole point is that this figure is NOT a capped edge count.
