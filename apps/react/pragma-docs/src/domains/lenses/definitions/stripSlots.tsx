/**
 * The Definitions lens's mode-strip tenants — the components the routes
 * park on their `meta` under `SHELL_STRIP_META_KEY`, which the Shell
 * mounts into the strip's `controls` and `status` sockets (the P-5
 * handshake).
 *
 * They take NO props: `StripSlotsEntry` carries component types, not
 * elements, so the frame constructs them with nothing. The FILTER reaches
 * them through `lensFilterContext` (see that module for why a context is
 * the smallest mechanism that crosses the frame boundary).
 *
 * THE DATA does NOT come through that context, and the reason is the SSR
 * determinism rule. An announcement from the explorer could only arrive in
 * an effect — client-only, after paint — so the strip would render empty
 * on the server and populated on the client: a hydration mismatch in the
 * frame itself. Instead these components read the SAME operation the
 * explorer reads, from the same warm store: the Shell renders inside
 * `RelayEnvironmentProvider`, and the route's prepare step has already
 * executed and serialised exactly this query. The read is a store hit on
 * both sides, the markup matches, and no second network request exists —
 * the one-operation-per-page register holds, because this is the same
 * operation with the same variables, not another one.
 *
 * THE FRAME MUST NEVER DEPEND ON WARM DATA. `useLazyLoadQuery` SUSPENDS on
 * a cold store, and these components render inside the Shell — outside any
 * page-level boundary. Unguarded, a cold render (a failed prepare step, a
 * graph that did not answer) suspends the whole document and takes the
 * frame, the rail and the canvas down with it; `entry.tests.tsx` caught
 * exactly that. So each socket carries its OWN Suspense and error
 * boundary, both falling back to nothing: an empty socket is the honest
 * rendering of "the graph did not answer", and the strip band —
 * stationary frame (AX.6) — stays intact either way.
