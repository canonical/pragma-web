/**
 * The explorer's west rail: every term the ontologies carry, grouped per
 * ontology into Classes and Properties, each item a term link. This rail
 * is the COMPLETE keyboard path through the explorer: it lists every term
 * the hierarchy well draws (and every property besides), so the graph
 * canvas never has to be traversed to reach anything — the well is a
 * spatial view over the same nouns, not the only path (WCAG 2.1.3).
 *
 * A REAL INDEX, to the exhibit's bar and past it. Each class item carries
 * the two REAL axes the ontology actually has — no invented status:
 *
 * - An ABSTRACTION marker (`data-abstraction`): a small glyph that restates
 *   exactly what the graph encodes with a dashed border and an ABSTRACT
 *   tag. The ontology carries `isAbstract` and `namespace` and NOTHING
 *   resembling a lifecycle/status/channel on a class (verified live —
 *   R7's lesson), so this rail marks abstractness and provenance and
 *   refuses to fake a status dot the data cannot back.
 * - A DEPTH indicator: the superclass depth (`depthByUri`, the same measure
 *   the well stacks its layers by) as the exhibit's monospace dot-run AND
 *   as a real indent, so the class tree's shape is legible in the flat list.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY (the exhibit's central heuristic, and our TTL contract's
 * demand): the rail DIMS, it never HIDES. Every term stays mounted in
 * document order under every filter, marked `data-dimmed` when it falls
 * out — so the index stays complete and stable, items never jump under the
 * cursor, and the number of things that exist never appears to change.
 * Only the graph hides (see `HierarchyWell`).
 *
 * Dimming is NOT disablement, and is deliberately not announced as such. A
 * dimmed item is still in the list, still focusable, and still navigates —
 * marking it `aria-disabled` told assistive technology the link was
 * unavailable when it plainly was not, which is a worse answer than saying
 * nothing. The state reaches a screen reader in words instead: each heading
 * reports its own match count, so a filter that dims everything says so
 * rather than falling silent. `data-dimmed` carries the visual cue and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * BIDIRECTIONAL HOVER (past the exhibit, whose hover only fades the graph):
 * pointing at — or keyboard-focusing — a rail item raises it as the shared
 * ego centre (`onHoverTerm`), so the WELL fades to that term's 1-hop
 * neighbourhood exactly as a graph-node hover does; and when the shared
 * centre (`hoverCentre`) names an item, that item takes `is-hovered`,
 * distinct from the `.active`/`aria-current` selection underneath. The
 * centre is CLIENT-ONLY and neutral (undefined) at mount, so it costs the
 * SSR-determinism argument nothing (see `DefinitionsExplorer`).
 *
 * Both filter axes reach this rail: the text query (rail-only by
 * contract — it never re-shapes the graph) and the chips (which govern
 * both). All of it is EPHEMERAL view state owned by `DefinitionsExplorer`
 * (the P-D7 transient tier), never the URL — a filtered rail is a way of
 * looking, not a place to link to.
 *
 * Selection needs no wiring here: the router's `Link` stamps
 * `aria-current="page"` on the item whose address is the current URL, and
 * hovering any item prefetches its term through the route's warm-up seam.
