/**
 * THE WELL ACTUALLY RE-RENDERS — the claim no other suite makes.
 *
 * The well is memoised at its boundary (`HierarchyWell`'s `memo`
 * comparator), and that comparator is the single point of failure for the
 * whole chip mechanism: it decides whether a filter change reaches React
 * Flow at all. Every OTHER consequence of a chip has its own independent
 * witness — the chip's `aria-pressed` flips in `ExplorerControls.tests`,
 * the status figure recounts in `stripSlots.tests` (a sibling reading the
 * same context), the rail dims in `TermRail.tests` — so if the comparator
 * were replaced by `return true`, freezing the graph forever, all 91
 * definitions tests still passed. The chips would visibly toggle, the
 * figure would recount, the rail would dim, and the GRAPH would sit
 * frozen, which is the one thing the lens exists to show.
 *
 * This file closes that. It mounts the page and the strip's Controls the
 * way PRODUCTION mounts them — siblings under one `LensFilterProvider`,
 * because the strip is rendered by the Shell outside the page's subtree —
 * clicks a real chip through the real UI, and asserts on the WELL'S OWN
 * NODES: the count carrying `is-hidden` must rise. Nothing here reads the
 * comparator, the filter object or any internal; the assertion is what a
 * reader would see in the graph.
 *
 * TEETH (verified by hand, and the reason this file exists): setting the
 * comparator body to `return true` makes the hidden count stay 0 and this
 * test fail. Restoring it makes it pass.
