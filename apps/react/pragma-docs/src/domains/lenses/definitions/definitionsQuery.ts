 * byte-identical variables everywhere. Artifact-only imports: this module
 * rides the server bricks' native import chain; the tag lives in
 * `DefinitionsExplorer.tsx`.
 *
 * ONE entry serves BOTH routes (`/definitions` and `/definitions/:term`):
 * the term-less explorer runs the same operation with `hasTerm: false`
