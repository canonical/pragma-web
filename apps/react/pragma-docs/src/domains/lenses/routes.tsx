/**
 * The v1 lens routes that have no views yet — honest minimal stubs
 * (P-4.1). Each states what lands on its canvas and which P-item builds
 * it; the shell frame around them is the finished product. Home keeps its
 * existing page (`#domains/marketing`); `/guides/:slug` (the reading
 * detail) already exists there too and stays. Components graduated to its
 * real views (`#domains/components`, P-5) and left this file; Definitions
 * graduated to the explorer triptych (`./definitions`, P-5) and left too;
 * Standards graduated to the reading views (`./standards`, P-5) and left
 * as well.
 *
 * None of these declare `SHELL_STRIP_META_KEY` strip slots: a stub has no
 * controls or status to claim, so every strip socket renders its sensible
 * empty — which is exactly what `frameStability.tests.tsx` measures.
 *
 * `guides` does declare ONE thing, and only one: its keyboard shortcut
 * (`#lib/routeShortcut`). A stub is still a destination, and the digit
 * belongs to whichever route owns the address — being unbuilt does not
 * change who allocates it.
