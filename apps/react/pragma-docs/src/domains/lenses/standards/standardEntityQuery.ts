/**
 * The standard reading route's query contract, lifted to the route level
 * (the P-2 D3 pattern): the compiled `StandardEntityQuery` operation plus
 * the one variables builder, exported from one module so the server
 * prepare step (`routes.ts` meta), the client prefetch seam
 * (`warmRouteQuery`), and the page's hook all execute the same operation
 * with byte-identical variables.
 *
 * This module imports the GENERATED artifact rather than declaring a tag:
 * it sits on the server bricks' native import chain (via `appRoutes`),
 * where no Vite transform rewrites tags. The tag lives next to the page
 * component (`StandardReadingPage.tsx`) as relay-compiler's source of
 * truth.
 *
 * URI SHAPE — THE ONE USER-VISIBLE COST OF DESPECIALISATION. The route
 * param used to be the compact form: `codeStandard(uri:)` accepted
 * `cs:react.component.props`, so `/standards/cs%3Areact.component.props`
 * was the graph's address spelled straight into the URL. The contract has
 * no `codeStandard` field, and its one entity lookup — `node(id:)` — takes
 * the ABSOLUTE IRI and nothing else (ke-graphql returns null for anything
 * failing `isAbsoluteIri`; the reference provider keys its index on the
 * absolute IRI; `EntityMeta.curie`'s own contract docstring says the curie
 * "is not accepted by `node(id:)`"). So the route param is now
 * `http%3A%2F%2Fpragma.canonical.com%2Fcodestandards%23react.component.props`.
 *
 * Keeping the curie in the URL and expanding it client-side via `toFullUri`
 * + `Query.ontologies` was considered and rejected: it needs the namespace
 * inventory SYNCHRONOUSLY, on both server and client, before routing —
 * `RouteQueryEntry.variables` is a synchronous pure function the SSR
 * prepare step calls directly. That means a namespace-inventory bootstrap,
 * its SSR serialisation and its client hydration path: a second source of
 * truth about namespaces. It is strictly additive later (only this builder
 * changes), so if compact addresses are wanted back, that bootstrap is the
 * shape of the work.
