/**
 * The extraction's policy contracts: linkable relations get real homes,
 * everything else stays inert; one entity is one node however many
 * relations name it; capped connections surface as `truncated`; and the
 * class term derives from data, never a namespace table.
 *
 * Every payload below carries the two-field identity the converged base
 * serves — `uri` the ABSOLUTE IRI, `_meta.curie` the graph's compact
 * rendering of it — and the two are deliberately DIFFERENT strings, so an
 * extraction that reverted to reading `uri` would fail every address
 * assertion here rather than passing by coincidence.
