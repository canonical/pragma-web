/**
 * The React Flow SSR keystone for this lens: the well renders its FULL
 * node and edge DOM to a string, with no browser API in the path.
 *
 * This works only because every node carries explicit `width`/`height`
 * and both `handles` from the deterministic layout, and because the
 * component holds no client-only state and never calls `fitView`. Each of
 * those is a real constraint, so each is asserted here rather than trusted.
