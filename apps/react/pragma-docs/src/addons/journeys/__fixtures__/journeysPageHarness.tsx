/**
 * Shared harness for the Journeys lens's warm-store tests: the REAL
 * `JourneysPage` under the real provider stack — a seeded (or cold) Relay
 * environment, `HeadProvider`, and a static router over the REAL app routes
 * at the page's own URL, because the rail, the well's nodes and the
 * inspector all render router-react `Link`s whose hrefs (and `aria-current`
 * selection) must come from the actual `journeysJob` codec.
 *
 * The rail filter still lives inside the explorer's own `useState`. The VIEW
 * switch (RULING 1) does NOT: it moved to the mode strip's `controls` socket,
 * so its ephemeral state lives in `journeyViewContext` — a shell-spanning
 * provider, exactly like the Definitions lens's filter context. This harness
 * therefore wraps the page in `JourneyViewProvider` (as `routes.tsx` wraps
 * the Shell), so the view is writable on every real render; `journeysStrip`
 * below additionally mounts the strip's own switch under the SAME provider,
 * the way the Shell mounts it as a sibling of the canvas.
 *
 * Lives in `__fixtures__` beside the captured record maps: imported by
 * tests, never collected as one.
