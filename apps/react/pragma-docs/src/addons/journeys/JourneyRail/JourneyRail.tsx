/**
 * The lens's west rail: the DEMAND INDEX — every coordinate the model
 * carries, and under each, every job it roots. This rail is the COMPLETE
 * keyboard path through the lens: it lists every job the well draws, so
 * the graph canvas never has to be traversed to reach anything (WCAG
 * 2.1.3). The well is a spatial view over the same nouns, not the only
 * path to any of them.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY, reused verbatim from the Definitions lens: the rail DIMS,
 * it never HIDES. Every coordinate and every job stays mounted in document
 * order under every filter, marked `data-dimmed` when it falls out — so
 * the index stays complete and stable, items never jump under the cursor,
 * and the number of things that EXIST never appears to change. Only the
 * graph narrows (the well is handed a filtered set). Dimming is NOT
 * disablement and is not announced as such: a dimmed row's control still
 * works, so `aria-disabled` would state something false. `data-dimmed`
 * carries the visual cue, and the counts beside the headings carry the
 * filter's effect in words.
 *
 * THE PERSONA AXIS IS LABELLED APPROXIMATE, IN THE INTERFACE. The graph
 * records no persona-to-job edge at all (measured: `Persona` carries no
 * role, actor or fluency axis), so the match is by role NAME and three of
 * the six personas match nothing that way. Rather than hide that behind a
 * confident-looking control, the note rides next to the chips as real
 * text. A filter that quietly lies is worse than no filter.
 *
 * Selection needs no wiring: the router's `Link` stamps
 * `aria-current="page"` on the job whose address is the current URL.
