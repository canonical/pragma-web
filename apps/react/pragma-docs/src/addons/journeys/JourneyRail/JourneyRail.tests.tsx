/**
 * The rail's two load-bearing claims:
 *
 * 1. IT DIMS, IT NEVER HIDES. Every coordinate and every job stays in the
 *    document under every filter, so the index is complete and stable and
 *    the number of things that EXIST never appears to change.
 * 2. THE PERSONA AXIS CONFESSES. It is approximate, and the caveat is
 *    real on-screen text rather than a tooltip — because a filter that
 *    quietly lies is worse than no filter at all.
