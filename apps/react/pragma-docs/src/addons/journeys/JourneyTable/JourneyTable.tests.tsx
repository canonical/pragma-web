/**
 * The table's STRUCTURE is its accessibility, so the structure is what this
 * suite asserts: a real `<table>` with a `<caption>`, `<th scope="col">`
 * for every column and `<th scope="row">` for the job cell, one data row
 * per model job, and the story surfaced as secondary text right in the
 * primary surface. The INTERACTION teeth — that a header click reorders the
 * rendered rows and a group control re-buckets them — live in
 * `journeyTableInteraction.tests.tsx`; this file pins the shape.
