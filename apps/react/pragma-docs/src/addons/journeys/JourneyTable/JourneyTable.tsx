/**
 * The Journeys lens's PRIMARY SURFACE: the demand model as a groupable,
 * sortable table.
 *
 * WHY THIS REPLACED A LIST. The lens shipped its index as a nested `<ul>`
 * showing a job's LABEL and nothing else, while the graph carried the
 * story, the acceptance criteria, the coordinate, the pairing counts and
 * the served state all along. A two-level bulleted list affords exactly one
 * arrangement and cannot answer the questions the model exists to answer
 * ("which jobs are unserved?", "which coordinate carries the most
 * demand?"). Those are sort and group questions. So the table is the
 * primary surface and the well is the SELECTED JOB'S detail — the honest
 * relationship, since the graph is good at one journey's shape and bad at
 * 52 at once (which is why it needed a default coordinate filter at all).
 *
 * A REAL TABLE, because the semantics are the accessibility. There is no
 * Table in the design system, so these are hand-rolled and deliberate:
 *
 * - a `<caption>` naming the table and stating its live row count;
 * - `<th scope="col">` for every column, `<th scope="row">` for the job
 *   cell, so a screen reader announces "Pairings, 3" against the job's own
 *   name rather than against a bare row number;
 * - `aria-sort` on the ACTIVE column only (WAI-ARIA allows at most one),
 *   derived by `ariaSortFor` so it cannot drift out of step;
 * - the sort control is a real `<button>` INSIDE the `<th>`, never a click
 *   handler on the cell — so it is tab-reachable and Enter/Space-operable
 *   for free, and its accessible name says what pressing it will do;
 * - grouping is one `<tbody>` PER GROUP, each opened by a group header row
 *   whose cell is a `<th colspan scope="rowgroup">` — the header labels
 *   the journey ROWS that follow it inside that `<tbody>`, and a row
 *   group is what a `<tbody>` is. (`colgroup`, which this carried until
 *   review caught it, tells assistive technology the header labels the
 *   COLUMNS instead — the wrong relationship stated confidently);
 * - expansion puts the detail in a `<tr>` IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING its row —
 *   DOM order, never a portal — with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`
 *   on the trigger, so the story and the acceptance criteria are one
 *   interaction away rather than one navigation away.
 *
 * SSR DETERMINISM. Sort, group and expansion are EPHEMERAL client state
 * and never enter the URL. The DEFAULT arrangement is a pure constant
 * applied by pure comparators (`journeyTableModel.ts`), so the server's
 * first paint and the client's first render produce identical markup.
 * Nothing here is ever seeded from `localStorage`, `window` or the query
 * string — that is the React 19 hydration mismatch a `console.error` spy
 * will not catch.
