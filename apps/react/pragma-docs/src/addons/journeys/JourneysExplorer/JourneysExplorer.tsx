/**
 * Codegen source of truth for `JourneysExplorerQuery`. Never invoked (this
 * module rides the server bricks' native import chain, where an evaluated
 * tag throws at module scope).
 *
 * THE QUERY ROOTS AT `pairings`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 *
 * The naive shape — root at `views` and walk down — structurally CANNOT
 * see this model: `Lens` is a separate type from `View`, so the 11
 * `composes` edges that hang off lenses are invisible from a `views` root.
 * Rooting at `pairings` and reading `pairsSurface` through the `Surface`
 * INTERFACE sees every implementor at once (`View`, `Lens`, `Port`,
 * `Peek`, `Detail`, `Mechanism`, `ComposerSurface`, `Editor` — all eight,
 * verified live). `composes` is declared ON the interface, so no inline
 * fragments are needed at all: one selection set covers every surface kind.
 *
 * THE TWO WINDOWS. `first:` hard-caps at 100 and the model holds 133
 * pairings, so ONE page silently loses 13 of the 51 paired jobs. The union
 * of `first:100` and `last:100` covers all 133 in ONE operation with no
 * cursor threading (see `journeysQuery.ts` for the full argument);
 * `collectJourneys` merges them by URI, so the 67-pairing overlap
 * collapses to nothing.
 *
 * `jobs` IS ALSO PAGINATED, deliberately. Its connection defaults to FIFTY
 * — measured — so the two jobs beyond that would vanish without an
 * explicit `first`. The variable is named and asserted rather than left to
 * a default that is not documented anywhere in the schema.
 *
 * `arrivals` and `pairingRole` are OBJECT types carrying URIs, not enums,
 * and 34 of 133 pairings carry no arrival — so both are read as nullable
 * URI-bearing nodes and mapped by local name downstream.

 * The Journeys lens's route root: the demand model as a triptych — the

 * job inspector east. ONE `useLazyLoadQuery` per page; the variables come
 * from the same builder the server prepare step and the prefetch seam use
 * (`journeysQuery.ts`), so the SSR-warmed store always fulfils this exact
 * operation.
 *
 * THE SCALE RULING, and why the default view is filtered. The full model
 * is ~260 nodes across five columns — unreadable at once, and
 * virtualisation is not open to us: React Flow SSRs only the nodes it is
 * given, so virtualising would break the determinism contract the well
 * depends on. So the lens DEFAULTS to one coordinate (the first by URI
 * order) and the rail offers the rest. That default is a pure function of
 * the query's own data, so it is identical on the server and the client.
 *
 * THE SSR DETERMINISM RULE. The filter's initial value is computed from
 * query data alone — never `localStorage`, `window` or the query string —
 * and the well has no client-only state whatsoever. Selection IS
 * server-rendered: it comes from the URL (`job`), identical on both sides.
