/**
 * THE VIEW-SWITCH TEETH (RULING 1 + RULING 2) — one reading at a time, and
 * the inspector column comes and goes, DOM-level.
 *
 * The owner's two rulings, pinned against the REAL explorer over the captured
 * warm store, reading the real DOM before and after a click — never a
 * "callback fired" assertion (the MED-1 lesson):
 *
 *   RULING 1 — the Table ⇄ Graph switch now lives in the MODE STRIP's
 *   `controls` socket, not the canvas. So this suite mounts the strip's
 *   switch alongside the page under ONE `JourneyViewProvider` (the
 *   production topology; the switch is a sibling of the canvas and context is
 *   the only path between them) and clicks the STRIP's toggles. Flipping to
 *   Graph must make the well's node DOM appear AND the table's own markup
 *   leave; flipping back must reverse it.
 *
 *   RULING 2 — the grid drops the inspector column in table mode. The
 *   explorer root is TWO-track in table mode (no inspector element, no third
 *   column) and THREE-track in graph mode (the inspector rides the right
 *   track). The teeth assert the inline `grid-template-columns` string AND
 *   the presence/absence of the inspector region — not merely the view swap.
 *
 * The default is the TABLE (two tracks, no inspector), and the SSR
 * determinism half is proved by the frame + hydrate suites (the default
 * view's markup is byte-fixed). Here we exercise the client transition the
 * strip's switch performs.
