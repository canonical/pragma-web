/**
 * The binding table's three invariants — each one a bug the module header
 * names, pinned here so a fork that edits the table gets told rather than
 * finding out at runtime with an empty page.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO assertion on the literal strings beyond their
 * shape. The values are the deployment's to choose; pinning
 * `"cs:CodeStandard"` would make a fork's first edit red for no reason and
 * would test nothing about the app.
