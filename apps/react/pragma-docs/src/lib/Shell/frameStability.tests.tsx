// @vitest-environment node

/**
 * The P-4.1 certification: switching lenses moves ONLY the canvas plate —
 * proven by measurement, not eyeballing.
 *
 * Method. Render `EntryServer`'s tree (static router, Relay environment,
 * the `<html>` document) to a string per lens URL — node environment, so
 * `renderToString` walks the exact SSR branch production walks. Called
 * directly, WITHOUT the `JSXRenderer` wrapper production puts around it:
 * the head/script wrapping `JSXRenderer` adds (`otherHeadElements`,
 * `scriptElements`, `linkElements`, the `__INITIAL_DATA__` injection) is out
 * of frame by construction — all of it lands in `<head>` or as scripts,
 * never inside `<body>`, which is exactly why the body-frame measurement
 * below stays valid without it. Split each page's `<body>` at the canvas
 * plate's stable structural identity (the single `<main
 * data-region="canvas">` element):
 * FRAME = body with the canvas's children cut out (the canvas open tag
 * itself is frame — its attributes are chrome). Then:
 *
 *   1. every canvas is pairwise distinct (the comparison is not vacuous);
 *   2. raw frames pairwise DIFFER — the accounted-for deltas (the
 *      router's `aria-current="page"`, and since P-5 the mode strip's
 *      claimed context text) are really present and visible to this
 *      measurement (the extraction has eyes on the rail and the strip);
 *   3. the aria-current placements are exactly the modelled expectation
 *      per URL (Home carries two: brand + Home lens, both `href="/"`),
 *      and the strip's three claimable slots — `context`, `controls`,
 *      `status` — match the per-URL model RAW; normalisation can never
 *      hide a wrong claim, because the raw content is asserted first;
 *   4. after normalising ONLY those deltas (strip the attribute, blank
 *      exactly the three claimed slots' contents), all frames are
 *      byte-identical (`toBe` on the strings);
 *   5. the normaliser forgives nothing else — synthetic perturbations to
 *      the strip's own region, to any slot's IDENTITY attributes, and to
 *      the frame at large all survive normalisation and fail the
 *      comparison.
 *
 * THE R5 LOOSENING (owner-approved, recorded here rather than smuggled).
 * Until AV-274 this suite asserted `controls` and `status` were EMPTY on
 * every URL, and its teeth test used planted status text as proof that the
 * normaliser's scope was one slot. The Definitions lens now claims both
 * sockets — a filter toolbar and a status figure — because a strip that is
 * never used is furniture pretending to be an instrument. So the model
 * widened: per-URL claims for all three slots, asserted RAW, with the
 * normaliser blanking exactly those three. The teeth test grew to
 * compensate, and now proves the widened normaliser still catches a
 * renamed socket, a tampered strip region, and frame changes elsewhere —
 * the properties the old status-planting control used to establish.
 *
 * The claims are asserted STRUCTURALLY, not as pinned strings: the status
 * figure carries a live count off the graph, and pinning it would turn
 * every ontology edit into a frame-stability failure — a false alarm about
 * something this suite does not measure.
 *
 * THE P-6 CONTEXT WIDENING (owner-ruled, recorded here rather than
 * smuggled). Until P-6 the `context` slot carried a bare lens-name STRING,
 * and its pattern was text-only. The owner ruling moved every page title out
 * of the canvas and INTO the strip as the DS `Breadcrumbs` pattern, so the
 * context slot now holds navigation MARKUP — the trail to the current page.
 * The model widened the same disciplined way the controls/status claims did:
 * the context slot's pattern is now markup-aware (bounded by the next slot),
 * the per-URL model asserts the FULL trail RAW (an index page's single
 * current crumb, or an entity page's linked lens crumb + current crumb whose
 * text is the ROUTE PARAM), the normaliser blanks exactly that slot, and the
 * teeth test's context perturbation still proves the blanking is scoped to
 * the slot's contents, never its identity. Because the trail is URL-derived
 * (a constant lens crumb + the route param, no graph read), pinning it does
 * NOT couple this suite to the ontology — a wrong claim still fails RAW
 * first. The breadcrumb's terminal crumb also carries one
 * `aria-current="page"` on a `<span>`; the raw aria-current census models it
 * per URL (added to the rail's anchor count), so the total stays exact.
 *
 * Since P-5 the measured set also carries a non-lens URL — the Button
 * entity page — rendered from its captured fixture records (initialData,
 * exactly what the dev servers embed), so its canvas is real content and
 * nothing in the render path waits on a network that node does not have.
 *
 * Alongside the markup claim, the stylesheet claims: the four layout
 * tokens and the four z-axis tokens are each DEFINED exactly once across
 * the app's stylesheets (regions consume, never re-define), and exactly
 * one LAYOUT-CAPABLE conditional at-rule — `@media` with any real
 * condition, every `@container`, every `@supports` — exists in the app:
 * the sanctioned AX.1 collapse in Rail/styles.css. Feature queries that
 * cannot reflow layout by design (`prefers-color-scheme`, `forced-colors`,
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`) are exempt, matched by query TEXT, never by
 * file — and only while no other condition rides along in the prelude.
 *
 * Head elements are outside the measurement on purpose: titles are
 * route-owned document state (a11y requires them to change), not chrome.
 * `frame stability` scopes to `<body>`.
