/**
 * The strip-socket facet: how the shell learns what the active route's
 * composed layout wants in the mode strip (the P-5 handshake).
 *
 * This replaces the hand-written `readStripSlots` reader. The behaviour is
 * unchanged — same key, same four diagnostics, same identity-preserving
 * return — but the AUTHORING side is now typed too: routes spread
 * `shellStripFacet.of({ … })` into `meta` instead of writing a bare computed
 * key with a `satisfies` beside it. The `satisfies` was doing the value
 * check by hand at every claim site; `of()` does it once, in the signature.
 *
 * Absence is fine (empty sockets), presence-and-malformed throws, because a
 * route that half-declares its strip is a bug, not an absence. The four
 * messages below are pinned by `stripFacet.tests.ts` — they are what makes
 * this the tenant whose migration proves the helper.
