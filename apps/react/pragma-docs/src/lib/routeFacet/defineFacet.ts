/**
 * A typed facet on a route's `meta` bag: ONE place per tenant for the key,
 * the value shape, and the assertion.
 *
 * Route `meta` is `Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>` and the router never
 * serialises it (`dehydrate()` emits routing state only — see
 * `src/relay/routeQuery.ts`'s header), so anything may live there at the
 * acknowledged cost of `unknown`-typed access. Before this helper each
 * tenant hand-wrote its own reader (`readRouteQueryEntry`, `readStripSlots`)
 * and each AUTHORING site wrote a bare computed key — which type-checks the
 * KEY but never the VALUE: `{ [SHELL_STRIP_META_KEY]: 42 }` compiles today.
 * `of()` closes that hole, because the value is checked where it is written;
 * `read()` keeps the assertion in one place for where it is consumed.
 *
 * THE CONVENTION BOTH EXISTING TENANTS ESTABLISHED, AND THIS HELPER KEEPS:
 * absence is fine (`undefined`), presence-and-malformed THROWS — a route
 * that half-declares a facet is a bug, not an absence. That is why `parse`
 * is a parser that throws the tenant's OWN message rather than a boolean
 * `value is T` guard: a guard collapses `readStripSlots`' four distinct
 * diagnostics ("not an object", "Context/Controls/Status is not a
 * component") into one generic failure, and those four messages are pinned
 * by `#lib/Shell/stripFacet.tests.js`.
 *
 * TENANTS, AND THE ONE HOLDOUT. `#lib/Shell/stripFacet.js` and
 * `#lib/routeShortcut/shortcutFacet.js` read through here.
 * `ROUTE_QUERY_META_KEY` (`src/relay/routeQuery.ts`) deliberately does NOT,
 * and is the next migration — with a PRECONDITION: `readRouteQueryEntry`'s four
 * error messages have no tests today (`src/server/routeQueries.tests.ts` is
 * happy-path only), and it sits on the SSR data path, whose only end-to-end
 * coverage is the e2e suite. Write those four message tests first, then
 * migrate. Until then the asymmetry in the route modules' `meta` literals —
 * a spread for the migrated tenants beside a bare computed key for the query
 * — is the un-migrated tenant marking itself. Leave it visible.
