/**
 * The keyboard grammar's lens digits (A.06 §9: `1–5` switch lenses),
 * wired as an EPHEMERAL document listener — attach on mount, detach on
 * unmount, no stored state anywhere (P-D7: the destination is URL state,
 * owned by the router; the listener itself owns nothing).
 *
 * The allocation comes from the ROUTE TABLE, not from a table beside it:
 * each lens route claims its own digit (`#lib/routeShortcut`) and this hook
 * collects them off `useRouter().routes`. The routes arrive through the
 * hook rather than through an `appRoutes` import on purpose — `routes.tsx`
 * imports Shell, Shell imports Rail, so importing back would close a cycle
 * that ESM survives only by accident of laziness. The hook also reflects
 * the table the router is ACTUALLY running, which is what makes the digits
 * derived rather than merely parallel.
 *
 * The hook RETURNS the allocation so the rail can display exactly what it
 * wires: one walk per render, one source, no way for the shown digit and
 * the live digit to disagree.
 *
 * Guards, in check order: no modifier chords (the browser's own
 * `Alt+digit` etc. stay untouched); no firing mid-IME-composition (the
 * digit is text being composed, not a command) or on key auto-repeat (a
 * held digit navigates once); no firing while the user types in an
 * editable target — digits belong to the text field then, not the
 * compass.
 *
 * WCAG 2.1.4 close-out (user disable toggle in the utility cluster) is
 * deferred — the guards here narrow the surface, they do not satisfy 2.1.4.
