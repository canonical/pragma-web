/**
 * Where the graph GraphQL endpoint lives — the ONE place that decides the URL.
 *
 * The graph now runs as its OWN process (`src/server/graph.ts`), so every
 * consumer — browser bundle, SSR prepare step, launcher — has to agree on one
 * absolute address. This module is that agreement, and it deliberately has
 * **zero imports**: `src/server/graph.ts` reads it to pick its listen port, and
 * that process hosts ke-graphql's pinned graphql v17 RC. Importing anything
 * from `#relay/environment.js` here would drag relay-runtime (and the app's
 * graphql v16) into the v17 process and reopen the two-versions tightrope.
 *
 * The port literal appears exactly ONCE, in {@link DEFAULT_GRAPHQL_URL};
 * `graph.ts` and `withGraph.ts` derive the number via `new URL(...).port`.
 *
 * ## The six-runtime matrix
 *
 * {@link resolveGraphqlUrl} has to answer in six different runtimes, which is
 * why it reads TWO sources before falling back:
 *
 * 1. **Vite dev (browser)** — `import.meta.env` is a live object Vite
 *    populates from `VITE_*` env vars and `.env` files.
 * 2. **Vite client build (`dist/client`)** — `import.meta.env.VITE_*` is
 *    statically replaced at build time. The client build deliberately does
 *    NOT see `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL`, so this arm compiles to the empty string /
 *    `undefined` and the browser falls through to the default. That is on
 *    purpose: the built bundle must not have a machine's dev port baked in.
 * 3. **Vite SSR build (`dist/server/renderer.js`)** — same static
 *    replacement, same deliberate miss; the compiled renderer therefore reads
 *    `process.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` at RUNTIME, which is exactly how
 *    `withGraph.ts` hands the preview bricks the live graph port. Do not
 *    "fix" the build to inject the variable — that would freeze one port into
 *    a deployable artifact.
 * 4. **Bun native** (`bun src/server/server.bun.ts`, `graph.ts`) —
 *    `import.meta.env` IS defined (Bun populates it from `process.env`), so
 *    the first arm already answers.
 * 5. **Node + tsx** (`server.express.ts`, `preview.express.ts`) — no Vite
 *    transform, no `import.meta.env`; the `?.` is load-bearing and the
 *    `process.env` arm answers.
 * 6. **Vitest (node environment)** — `import.meta.env` exists and Vitest
 *    keeps it in step with `process.env`, so either arm may answer with the
 *    same value.

/**
 * The graph server's address when nothing configures one.
 *
 * ABSOLUTE, not the same-origin `/graphql` this app used while the endpoint
 * was mounted on the web server: the graph is a separate process on its own
 * port now, and the SSR prepare step (which has no origin to resolve a
 * relative URL against) must be able to reach it.
 *
 * The port literal `5175` lives here and nowhere else — one digit above the
 * web servers' 5174, so the pair reads as a set.
 *
 * ## It is a DEVELOPMENT default, and a deployment must replace it
 *
 * `127.0.0.1` is the reader's own machine, so a browser that falls through to
 * this value in a deployed build cannot reach anything. Nothing in the app
 * rescues that, and nothing should: the web servers deliberately do not proxy
 * `/graphql` (the graph is a separate process hosting ke-graphql's pinned
 * graphql v17, and putting it back behind the web server is the arrangement
 * the process split undid).
 *
 * The replacement is a BUILD-TIME one, and it already exists — set
 * `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` to a publicly reachable address when running
 * `build:client`, and Vite statically replaces it into the browser bundle:
 *
 * ```sh
 * VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=https://graph.example.com/graphql bun run build:client
 * ```
 *
 * The repository's own build does not set it, which is why arm 2 below
 * compiles to nothing here — a machine's dev port must never be frozen into a
 * committed artifact. That is the default, not a limit: a deployment that
 * leaves the variable unset ships a bundle pointing at the reader's loopback,
 * and that is a deployment error rather than a thing to work around in code.
