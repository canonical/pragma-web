/**
 * Execute `entry`'s query into the published prefetch environment,
 * fire-and-forget, unless the store can already fulfil it.
 *
 * - No published environment (SSR, tests that never hydrate) → no-op.
 * - `environment.check(operation)` "available" → no-op. LOAD-BEARING: the
 *   browser router's initial `performLoad` fires this hook for the very URL
 *   the server just seeded — without the guard, hydration would refetch the
 *   SSR-delivered page over HTTP (the hydration fetch-spy tests catch
 *   exactly that regression).
 * - Otherwise fetch, swallowing errors: a failed warm-up costs nothing —
 *   the route's own `useLazyLoadQuery` refetches and owns error surfacing.
 *
 * Caveat, documented not fixed: nothing retains the fetched operation, so
 * the warmed records live in the store's release buffer. That comfortably
 * covers the hover→click window; a pinned-retain scheme is deliberately
 * deferred until a real eviction shows up.
 *
 * `params`/`search` arrive `unknown` from the router's prefetch surface;
 * the entry's own `variables` builder is the single place that asserts
 * their shape (same contract as the server collector in `routeQueries.ts`).
