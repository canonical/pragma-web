/**
 * The graph GraphQL server — its own process, serving ONLY `/graphql`.
 *
 * Until PRD-3 the ke-graphql backend was mounted inside whichever web server
 * happened to be running (a Vite plugin, a Bun brick, an Express middleware).
 * That put an Oxigraph WASM store and ke-graphql's pinned graphql v17 RC into
 * the same process as the app's graphql v16 and the render world. This file
 * is the split: one process boots the store, compiles the schema, and answers
 * HTTP. Everything else — dev servers, preview servers, the browser, the SSR
 * prepare step — talks to it over the wire at
 * {@link DEFAULT_GRAPHQL_URL} (or `GRAPH_PORT`).
 *
 * **The provider is no longer assembled here.** It comes from
 * `@canonical/prism-pragma-provider`, which owns pragma's ref-package list,
 * its semantic-package list, the shim-concept exclusion, the `anatomy:uri`
 * mapping and the compiler options — every fact about pragma's specific
 * ontologies that used to live in this app's `src/server/graphql.ts`. What is
 * left in this file is TRANSPORT: the port, the hostname, the `/graphql`-only
 * routing and the per-request hit log. This app depends on no knowledge engine
 * at all: neither `@canonical/ke` nor `@canonical/ke-graphql` appears in its
 * dependencies. Point it at any provider implementing
 * `@canonical/prism-contract` with `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` and none of this
 * changes.
 *
 * **Named `graph.ts`, not `graph.bun.ts`.** The `.bun` / `.express` suffix in
 * this directory encodes the 2×3 server matrix (two modes × three targets).
 * The graph has no matrix: there is exactly one of it, it always runs under
 * Bun, and neither the mode nor the web target changes it.
 *
 * **Boots EAGERLY.** `createPragmaProvider()` is awaited BEFORE `Bun.serve`,
 * so "listening" means "schema compiled" — a launcher that races readiness
 * gets an honest answer instead of a socket that accepts and then spends
 * thirty seconds parsing Turtle. A boot failure exits non-zero carrying the
 * provider's own actionable message (the refs-cache hint), rather than
 * serving 500s forever. The provider used to memoise itself behind a lazy
 * `getGraphqlBackend()`; there is exactly one boot and this line is it, so
 * the singleton went away with the module it lived in.
 *
 * **Serves only `/graphql`.** Every other path is a JSON 404 — never HTML.
 * A consumer that has been misconfigured to point at the web server (or vice
 * versa) then fails on content type instead of silently parsing a page.
