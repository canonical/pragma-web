/**
 * The cold-store guard on the server entry's Relay environment.
 *
 * A server render that reaches the network is always a bug: the prepare
 * step has already run, so a miss means the store and the render disagree
 * about the operation or its variables.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM CHANGED AT PRD-3, the assertions did not. Before AV-350
 * the endpoint was the same-origin `/graphql`, which the default HTTP path
 * could not resolve server-side: it threw ERR_INVALID_URL from inside a
 * promise React never awaits — an UNHANDLED REJECTION, which takes the
 * whole server PROCESS down. The endpoint is an absolute URL now, so
 * without the guard the same cold render would instead make a REAL fetch
 * to the graph server and reject only if that fetch fails (which, under
 * this suite, it does — nothing is listening on the default port). Either
 * way the rejection is unowned, and either way these tests catch it; the
 * difference is that the modern failure is slower and quieter, which is a
 * reason to keep the guard rather than to relax it.
 *
 * The guard reports the miss as a REJECTED PROMISE that Relay owns
 * (its network contract for a failed operation) rather than a synchronous
 * throw: a throw escapes during the render pass, which the express brick
 * turns into a hard 500 while the bun brick — shell already flushed —
 * degrades instead. The two bricks must not disagree.
 *
 * Teeth. `renderToString` COMPLETING is not the assertion: it completes
 * either way, because the crash is asynchronous. What this pins is that
 * no unhandled rejection escapes to the process — the actual failure
 * mode. Removing the `fetchFn` guard from `entry.tsx` fails the first
 * test here (verified by reverting it).
