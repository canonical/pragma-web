/**
 * Compiled JSX app renderer for production / preview.
 *
 * Read once at module load, the built `dist/client/index.html` shell carries
 * the hashed `<script>`/`<link>` tags Vite injected at build time; the renderer
 * extracts them and injects them into the streamed output.
 *
 * This is one Lego brick — a pure renderer. It knows nothing about routing or
 * about the sitemap renderer; it just turns a request into the rendered app.
 * The server (`src/server/index.ts` for preview, `server.bun.ts` /
 * `server.express.ts` for dev) is what looks at the URL and picks a renderer.
 *
 * It reuses the same `EntryServer` (`src/server/entry.tsx`) the dev servers
 * load via `ssrLoadModule` — the renderer is the invariant across dev and
 * production; only the HTML shell source differs.

 * user's preference, and runs the Relay prepare step so the preview bricks
 * server-render real data — all three ride the renderer's initial data.
 *
 * **The Oxigraph-bundle spike is CLOSED, and this is where it shows.** The
 * preview bricks used to carry no prepare step because preparing meant
 * importing an in-process ke-graphql backend, and nobody had verified that a
 * WASM store could be bundled into `dist/server`. Since the PRD-3 process
 * split, preparing means POSTing to the graph server — so this module's
 * import graph reaches `prepareRelayData` → `routeQueries` → the app's routes
 * and stops there. It never reaches the store or the schema-plugin packages,
 * and no WASM enters `dist/server`. The standing proof is to build the server
 * bundle and grep the emitted code for the store package's name: zero hits
 * (matches inside TSDoc do not count — this bundle preserves comments).
 *
 * Async because of that step: the two preview bricks await this factory.
