/**
 * The route→query collector: maps route name → the server-executable query
 * entry each route parks on its `meta` (P-2 D3).
 *
 * The server bricks import `appRoutes` natively through this module and run
 * their own static match — a deliberate double-match (one here for data, one
 * in `EntryServer` for render). In the dev servers these route objects live
 * in a different module registry than `EntryServer`'s (native vs
 * `ssrLoadModule`), which is safe for matching and for reading values off
 * `meta`: the entries are plain data plus a compiled query artifact.
 *
 * That double registry is no longer about the graph backend. It used to be:
 * the prepare step held an in-process ke-graphql singleton, and an SSR-graph
 * import would have booted a second Oxigraph store. Since the PRD-3 process
 * split there is no backend in this process at all — but the double match
 * SURVIVES, because the data pass must run to completion BEFORE the render
 * pass starts, and the render pass is the thing that lives behind
 * `ssrLoadModule`.
 *
 * Follow-up (not this story): now that nothing native is load-bearing here,
 * `prepareRelayData` could load its routes through `vite.ssrLoadModule`
 * instead, collapsing the two registries into one and retiring
 * `nodeCssNoop.ts` with them.

 * The HTTP status the routed document deserves: 200 for a matched route, 404

 *
 * WHY THE SERVER HAS TO ASK. `JSXRenderer` starts at 200 and only ever moves
 * to 500 on a shell error, so an unknown URL renders the not-found page and
 * still tells the client — and every crawler — that the page exists. The
 * renderer takes a `statusCode` option for exactly this, and it can only be
 * given at construction, which is why the match is resolved here rather than
 * read off the render.
 *
 * The match is SYNCHRONOUS, so this costs one extra static match per request
 * and no awaiting. A `redirect` route would carry a 3xx status of its own; it
 * is deliberately not passed through, because a redirect is a `Location`
 * header the entry point must send rather than a document to render, and no
 * route in this app is one today.
