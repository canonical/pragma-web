/**
 * The server-side data prepare step: match the URL, execute the matched
 * route's query to completion against the graph server, and serialise the
 * resulting Relay store for hydration.
 *
 * One function, integrated into ALL FOUR server bricks — the two dev servers
 * (`server.bun.ts`, `server.express.ts`) and, since the PRD-3 process split,
 * the two preview bricks by way of the compiled `renderer.tsx`. The preview
 * bricks could not have it before because the backend was in-process and
 * bundling an Oxigraph WASM store into `dist/server` was an unverified spike.
 * The graph is a separate process now, so the prepare step is just an HTTP
 * client and every brick can have one.
 *
 * ## No incremental drain here any more
 *
 * The previous in-process adapter had to drain ke-graphql's incremental
 * results itself (`isIncrementalResults` / `mergeIncremental`) because it
 * called the executor directly. Over HTTP that is the SERVER's job, and
 * ke-graphql already does it: `createGraphQLHandler` merges incremental
 * results into one complete JSON response whenever the request does not
 * accept `multipart/mixed` — see
 * `node_modules/.../ke-graphql/src/http/createGraphQLHandler.ts:392-400`.
 * Its `accepts` helper (`:133-143`) requires an EXACT media-type match, and
 * the wildcard `Accept` header relay-runtime's fetch sends selects no
 * media type exactly — so the drain always fires for us.
 *
 * The route→query map still lives in THIS (native) module registry: the dev
 * bricks load `EntryServer` and the rest of the render world via
 * `ssrLoadModule`, so the deliberate double-match (one here for data, one in
 * `EntryServer` for render) crosses a registry boundary carrying only plain
 * data — see `routeQueries.ts`.
