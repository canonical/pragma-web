/**
 * The launcher: bring the graph server up, then run a web command against it.
 *
 * Every `dev*` / `preview*` script goes through here —
 * `bun src/server/withGraph.ts <command> [args…]` — so the six cells of the
 * server matrix all get the same graph, the same way, without any of them
 * knowing how the graph is started.
 *
 * **It lives in `src/server/` on purpose.** A `scripts/` directory would be
 * covered by neither gate: `tsconfig.json`'s `include` lists `src` (plus the
 * named config files) and `biome.json`'s `files.includes` lists `src`. A
 * launcher that no longer type-checks is a launcher that breaks every script
 * at once, so it belongs where the checks can see it.
 *
 * What it does, in order:
 *
 * 1. Decide the graph port (`GRAPH_PORT`, else the port in
 *    {@link DEFAULT_GRAPHQL_URL}).
 * 2. If `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` is already set, spawn NO graph child at all and
 *    point the web command at that endpoint. That is the affordance for
 *    running against a shared or remote graph; it is also what keeps this
 *    launcher from fighting a graph someone already has running.
 * 3. Otherwise spawn `bun src/server/graph.ts`, NOT detached — the e2e
 *    harness spawns the whole script detached and tears it down with a
 *    process-GROUP kill, so a detached grandchild would escape the group and
 *    leak a port into the next cell.
 * 4. Race readiness against the graph child's own exit. If the child dies
 *    first (no refs cache, port in use, …) say so loudly and continue
 *    IMMEDIATELY — waiting out a two-minute budget for a process that is
 *    already dead turns a clear failure into a mysterious timeout.
 * 5. Spawn the web command from `process.argv.slice(2)` verbatim, no shell,
 *    with `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` injected EXPLICITLY. The explicit injection is
 *    the point: Bun auto-loads `.env`, Vite loads `.env` itself, plain Node
 *    loads nothing — passing the value through the environment is the only
 *    thing all three agree on.
 * 6. Forward SIGINT/SIGTERM to both children, kill the graph when the web
 *    command exits, and exit with the web command's code.
 *
 * No exit from here may leave the graph behind, which is why the signal
 * handlers are installed BEFORE either spawn (a signal during the graph's
 * boot would otherwise orphan it) and why both children carry an `error`
 * listener (an unhandled spawn `error` event terminates the launcher, and at
 * the web spawn the graph is already live).
 *
 * @note Impure — spawns processes, reads the environment, and exits.
