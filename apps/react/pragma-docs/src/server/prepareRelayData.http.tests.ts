/**
 * The prepare step's HTTP contract, against a real socket.
 *
 * This is the suite that carries the PRD-3 process split. The e2e matrix
 * cannot: its probe cells need the pragma refs cache (`pragma sources
 * update`) to compile a schema, and a machine without one fails them for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with this wiring. So the wire format is
 * pinned here instead, against a stub HTTP server on an OS-assigned port —
 * no graph, no WASM, no refs cache, and no way for the assertions to pass
 * vacuously.
 *
 * What it pins:
 *
 * - the request LEAVES the process (the old prepare step called an
 *   in-process executor; nothing crossed a socket, so nothing could have
 *   been asserted about one);
 * - it carries the operation's full text and the route's variables;
 * - it carries `x-pragma-ssr: 1`, which is the graph server's only way to
 *   tell a server render from a browser and therefore the load-bearing half
 *   of the e2e suite's hit-counting assertions;
 * - the response is deserialised into the Relay store and handed back as
 *   `{records}`;
 * - an unreachable endpoint degrades (logged `undefined`) instead of
 *   throwing — a graph that is down must cost the page its data, not its
 *   200.
 *
 * The routes table is mocked with a VALID entry (the real
 * `ComponentProbeQuery` artifact and its real variables builder, exactly as
 * `src/relay/environment.tests.ts` uses them): `readRouteQueryEntry` demands
 * a non-empty `query.params.text` and a `variables` FUNCTION, so a
 * hand-rolled stub would be rejected during collection and every case here
 * would pass through the degradation path instead of the transport.
