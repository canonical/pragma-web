/**
 * Client-side NAVIGATION over a hydrated app — the test class every suite
 * missed. Hydration tests mount one URL; the e2e never clicks. This file
 * drives the real user journey end to end: hydrate the catalog, click
 * through to an entity page, come back, then go back again through
 * history.
 *
 * What this file actually pins — an INTEGRATION contract, not a single
 * bug. Across every transition (link click forward, rail link back,
 * `history.back()`) it asserts: the destination DOM is correct, React
 * reported ZERO recoverable errors, and the network was NEVER touched.
 * That covers the seeded store surviving navigation, the prefetch guards
 * holding, and the rail's links resolving through the real router codecs.
 *
 * What it does NOT pin, despite its origin. This file was written for the
 * Outlet hook-attribution bug (a route wired `content: PageComponent` ran
 * the page's hooks in OUTLET's hook list, throwing "Rendered fewer hooks
 * than expected" on the first navigation between pages of differing hook
 * counts). Since AV-340 / PR #880 the router renders routes as real
 * fibers, and BOTH wiring styles are now safe — rewiring a route back to
 * the old crashing form leaves this file GREEN. The hook-ownership
 * regression is therefore pinned where it can still fail, upstream:
 * `packages/react/router/src/lib/Outlet/Outlet.test.tsx`, "Outlet hook
 * ownership (AV-340)". Do not read this file as that guard.
