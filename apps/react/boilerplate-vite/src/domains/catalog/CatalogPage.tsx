        This page demonstrates the Relay data layer. <code>ProductList</code>{" "}
        issues a <code>useLazyLoadQuery</code>, each <code>ProductCard</code>{" "}
        reads its own <code>useFragment</code>, and the environment resolves
        operations against the local mock schema in{" "}
        <code>src/relay/schema.ts</code> — set <code>VITE_GRAPHQL_URL</code> to
        point it at a real endpoint instead.

        SSR: the server prefetches this route's declared query (see
        `serverQueries` in src/routes.tsx) and seeds both render environments
        from the captured payloads, so `useLazyLoadQuery` (store-or-network)
        renders synchronously on the server and on first client render — the
        product list is real server-rendered HTML and the client issues no
        second fetch. If the prefetch failed, the query suspends and fetches
        through the active environment instead.

      {/*
        The canonical Relay pairing: Suspense renders the pending state while
        `useLazyLoadQuery` is in flight, and the ErrorBoundary renders the
        failure state when the query errors (e.g. an unreachable endpoint in
        `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` mode) — without it a thrown query error would
        unmount the whole tree to a blank page.
      */}
      {/*
        On the server, the query renders only when the SSR prefetch already
        seeded the store — after a failed or timed-out prefetch, querying here
        would re-issue the same doomed request mid-stream. The loading
        fallback is rendered instead and the client fetches after hydration;
        markup matches, since a client without payloads paints the same
        fallback via Suspense first.
